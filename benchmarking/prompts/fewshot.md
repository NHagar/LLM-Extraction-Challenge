# Examples
## Example 1
**INPUT:** The radical environmental agenda is destroying American jobs, and Senator Marcus Thompson is leading the fight to stop it. I'm Rebecca Martinez, National Director of Americans for Energy Independence, and I'm writing because we need patriots like you to join our mission. While Washington elites push their green new deal nonsense that will bankrupt working families, Senator Thompson is standing up for common sense energy policies that put America first. But he's facing MILLIONS in dark money from coastal elites who want to shut down our coal plants and oil refineries. That's why Americans for Energy Independence is mobilizing grassroots conservatives across the nation to fight back. We've already helped block three major environmental regulations this year, but we need your help to continue this critical work. Will you chip in $25, $50, or even $100 today to help us defend American energy independence? Every dollar you contribute goes directly toward organizing rallies, funding conservative candidates, and pushing back against the radical left's anti-energy agenda. Thank you for standing with us. Paid for by Americans for Energy Independence, a 527 political organization. Contributions are not tax deductible. Americans for Energy Independence, 1247 K Street NW, Washington, DC 20005.

## Example 3
**INPUT:** John, Something unprecedented is happening in Washington. Both parties are failing the American people, and it's time for a new approach. I'm David Chen, founder of the Center for Balanced Governance, and I'm writing because frustrated Americans like you are demanding better leadership. While Democrats and Republicans fight over partisan politics, real issues affecting working families go ignored. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing. Infrastructure is crumbling. The national debt keeps growing. That's why the Center for Balanced Governance is supporting pragmatic candidates from both parties who are willing to work together on solutions. We've already helped elect 12 moderate candidates who are focused on results over party loyalty. But we need to expand our efforts before the midterms. Your contribution of $35 today will help us identify and support more independent-minded candidates who put people over politics. Together, we can break the cycle of partisan gridlock and get Washington working again. The Center for Balanced Governance is organized under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code.

## Example 4
**INPUT:** Friend, Governor Lisa Patterson just announced her re-election campaign, and the attacks from out-of-state donors have already begun. We have less than 72 hours to hit our quarterly fundraising goal and show that Florida families are behind Governor Patterson's proven leadership. Since taking office, Governor Patterson has cut taxes three times, brought record jobs to our state, and stood up to federal overreach. But her opponent is being backed by millions from California billionaires who want to turn Florida into another failed liberal experiment. I'm asking you to stand with Governor Patterson by contributing $20 or whatever you can afford right now. Our grassroots supporters have always been the backbone of our movement, and we're counting on you again.
