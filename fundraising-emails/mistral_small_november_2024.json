In 2022, Adam Frischnearly defeated Lauren Boebert. He lost by just 546 votes. That scared LaurenBoebert so much that she came running to my district. But the voters ofeastern Colorado don\u2019t want a carpetbagging extremist more concerned withgetting on Fox News than the needs of her constituents. Even Republicans aredone with Boebert: 57% voted for someone else in the primary! We can finallykick Lauren Boebert out of Congress in November, but the only way I\u2019ll be ableto win is if we hit every fundraising goal and have the resources to fullyfund my campaign. We\u2019ve set a goal of raising another $250,000 before ourfinal end-of-month fundraising deadline, but right now, we\u2019re still incrediblyshort. So I have to ask: Please, if you can afford to, will you make adonation to my campaign \u2013 every dollar you can spare \u2013 to help me defeatLauren Boebert?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Every dollar you give today will bring us one step closer to finally sendingLauren Boebert packing, and truly no amount you can afford is too small.

This is the bestchance we've had to defeat Brown in years. \u25ba Senator Ted Cruz is theDemocrats' #1 target this year, and they are dumping millions of dollars intoTexas to turn Texas Blue. His opponent, Rep. Colin Allred, is a Kamala Harrisliberal who is desperately trying to hide his record. The Hill/Emerson Collegepoll showed Cruz leading by only one point. \u25ba Conservative former TV newsanchor Kari Lake is surging in Arizona and only trails liberal Ruben Gallegoby four points. But apparently, she's too conservative for Mitch McConnell,who refuses to spend the party's money to support her. There's still time forher to win in a state where President Trump is expanding his lead. \u25ba Armycombat veteran Sam Brown is rapidly gaining on incumbent Senator Jacky Rosenin Nevada. Republicans are doing exceptionally well with early voting, andBrown only trails by three points, according to the latest Rasmussen Reportspoll.

That\u2019s why I am so excited about Trisha\u2019s campaign: **New polling shows that Trisha can win and defeat Lauren Boebert! But Trisha can only flip this seat blue if she is able to raise enough money and fully fund her campaign.** I\u2019m ready to help Trisha Calvarese take on Lauren Boebert and finally kick her out of Congress, and I am asking you to join me today: **Please, will you make a donation right now to Trisha Calvarese\u2019s campaign to help her defeat Lauren Boebert this November? Winning this seat and turning it blue not only means getting rid of Boebert, but it will also get us one step closer to taking back the House for Democrats.** _Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  This election is about integrity and decency.

        "body": "Peter, Friday November 1st marks the 3rd day of early voting here in Oklahoma.So what are the three things you need to know? First of all, there just sohappen to be 3 judges of the Oklahoma Supreme Court on the ballot. And theyare ALL liberal. They are all THREE appointed by Democrat Governors. And wehave the chance to remove all three at once. If WE vote NO on all threeliberal Supreme Court judges, they will be removed and can no longer be ableto force their liberal agenda on Oklahoma. The question on your ballot will beif Edmonson, Gurich, & Kauger should be retained in their current positions.And the answer is NO, they should not be retained. All three must go, so wemust all VOTE NO! Secondly, you\u2019ll be voting on several candidates beyond justthe President. We can all compare the economic boom with 4 years of PresidentTrump to the disastrous 4 years under Biden-Harris. If your mind isn\u2019t alreadymade up on who to vote for as President think of how much better off you were4 years ago & realize we can have that again. There are other candidates onthe ballot, so the easiest way to vote is to choose \u201cRepublican\u201d straightparty voting. That\u2019ll make your selection for all those races & help put inRepublicans at the State & local level to help restore our economy & keep moremoney in your pockets. And third, you\u2019ll also have two State Questions on yourballot. SQ833 creates new tax structures. Many people are torn on how to votefor this, but we\u2019ll just put out there that we don\u2019t believe the governmentneeds MORE ways to tax us. If you agree we don\u2019t need more tax options, you\u2019llvote no on this one. As for SQ834 it would clarify that ONLY citizens can votein Oklahoma elections. It\u2019s obvious part of the Biden-Harris open border planis to get more people voting, including non-citizens. In fact a dozen citiesalready allow non-citizens to vote INCLUDING Washington DC! We must secure ourelections by allowing ONLY citizens to vote. Otherwise liberal court judges(refer to the first item listed above!) will allow law-breaking foreigners tovote in our elections. So there you have it, the three things you need toknow. 1) Vote no on all THREE Supreme Court judges. 2) Vote Republicanstraight party. 3) On the State Questions vote for lower taxes & ONLY citizensvoting. -Team OKGOP -=-=- Paid for by OKGOP and not authorized by anycandidate or candidate's committee. www.OKGOP.com - (405) 528-3501. 4031 N.Linconln Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK 73105 This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.

Afterthe extremism and division we have seen in recent years, we need to go forwardtogether \u2013 and that means electing folks like Derek Tran who will stand up forthe values we all believe in. Will you help me support Derek as he takes onthe brunt of the Republican fundraising arm and works to flip this criticalseat?

Friend, I was just boots on the ground at the border in New Mexico, once again assessing the situation and reminding voters justhow bad Kamala Harris and Martin Heinrich have allowed it to become. Of course, \u201cbad\u201d is the understatement of the century. Words and phrases like \u201chorrifying,\u201d \u201cdeadly,\u201d and \u201cworst in history\u201d get closer to appropriate descriptions of what has happened under their watch. And it\u2019s not like they just allowed it to happen \u2013 they curated this disaster! There\u2019s NO WAY we can allow Harris or Heinrich to continue failing us in Washington, D.C., and I need your help to defeat them and their radical agenda here in New Mexico. I am ready to get to work on DAY ONE with Pres. Trump to secure our borders and fix what the left has broken. We\u2019re so close to the finish line, and I need your help to get across. Please rush $10 or more to help us keep fighting every minute all the way until the end, when we\u2019ve flipped this seat, secured the Senate, and ensured we have the ability to get our country back on track. Thank you, Nella Domenici Help Elect Nella and Secure the Border \u00bb ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Butwith right-wing extremists like Marjorie Taylor Greene on the same committee,Alexandria noted just how much harder holding these contractors accountablemay become. Alexandria can\u2019t do this work alone \u2014 she needs a movementalongside her. And when we\u2019re able to post strong fundraising numbers, we'reable to expand our movement, elect more progressive leaders, and keepAlexandria in Congress fighting for us all.

        "body": "Please read this full message Fellow Patriot, At West Point, we had a code:cadets don't lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do. First the New YorkTimes lied about my childhood and family, and now CNN is lying about mybusiness record. And what\u2019s worse, they are doing it all because I\u2019m withinstriking distance of an entrenched career politician, Bob Casey, in the #1swing state in the nation that will determine control of the U.S Senate. BobCasey is getting Leftist news sources to do his dirty work, and I WON\u2019TTOLERATE IT. Here's the truth: this is a long message and I hope you will readall the way to the end. I grew up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. We lived oncampus at Bloomsburg State College and my parents owned a farm ten minutesdown the road. I had summer jobs baling hay and trimming Christmas trees atnearby farms. My dad started his career teaching history, economics, &democracy at Punxsutawney High. My mom began teaching fourth through sixthgraders at a public school near Pittsburgh. I\u2019m incredibly proud that my dadwas chosen to be president of Bloomsburg State College (now BloomsburgUniversity) at only 34 years old. I\u2019m so proud of my parents\u2019 teachingcareers and to have been raised in Bloomsburg. It was there that I wrestledand played football and was nominated to the U.S. Military Academy at WestPoint. And it was there that I came home to a parade after serving in combatduring the Gulf War. After the Army, I earned a Ph.D. in internationalrelations before moving to Pittsburgh to start a career in business. I workedmy way up to become the CEO of FreeMarkets, a successful tech startup thatemployed hundreds in Western Pennsylvania. I was then called to serviceagain, this time in the highest levels of government as Under Secretary ofTreasury and as Deputy National Security Advisor. Following this, I joinedBridgewater Associates, one of the largest, most successful investment firmsin the world, which manages the pension plans of groups including teachers,firefighters and law enforcement. I have lived the American Dream, and I amrunning for Senate to bring my decades of experience and love for our countryto fix our broken economy that is a direct result of policies supported by myopponent, who has spent 18 years in Washington with NOTHING to show for it. Iknew getting into this race could mean things would get nasty, but it\u2019s sad tosee we\u2019ve fallen so far that these media outlets like the New York Times andCNN are pushing the Democrats\u2019 baked narrative about my upbringing and mybusiness record. I\u2019ve opened myself and my family up to attacks from theleft, and every day feels like a battle. But I\u2019m no stranger to fighting forwhat is right andif we don\u2019t elect leaders to go to DC to clean up the messthe career politicians made, we will lose America as we know it! Here\u2019s whereI need your help, Fellow Patriot. We need to combat these lies with the TRUTHabout me. The Democrats are seeing the same polls you and I see. They know ifKamala Harris and Bob Casey lose Pennsylvania, they lose it ALL, and they aregoing to do WHATEVER IT TAKES to try and defeat me. I hate asking for money \u2014I\u2019m not a career politician, and it\u2019s not in my nature \u2014 but I have no choicebut to ask if we\u2019re going to hit our fundraising goal for the final stretch ofthe campaign.Will you chip in $30 or more right now to fight back against thelies from the Left? Chuck Schumer and his allies are working overtime toobliterate my campaign. They have committed to spend whatever it takes todefeat me.They know if I win this race in Pennsylvania, it\u2019ll be IMPOSSIBLEfor Democrats to keep their majority in the Senate. If we don\u2019t show theDemocrats we can win this race, it\u2019s game over. That\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping you canspare$29, $50, or even $100 to help me fight back against the lies. DONATEYour donation will take us one step closer to victory, and I am so gratefulfor your support. Thank you, Dave McCormick P.S. Democrats from all over thecountry are pouring money into this race to defeat me because they know thisrace could flip the Senate red.Will you chip in $29 or more to make sure Ihave the resources to WIN?

I\u2019m fired up, Peter! The energy at President Trump\u2019s rally in Albuquerque today was palpable. I could feel it on stage while delivering my own remarks, and it was apparent to anyone who was there todaythat something special is happening in New Mexico. We\u2019re on the cusp of flipping this state red and electing new leadership that will secure our border, lower our cost of living, get tough on crime, improve education, and unleash our abundant natural resources. I need you to keep fighting every single day, every single moment, until the polls close on Tuesday. Our campaign is working 24/7 to reach remaining undecided voters and get out the vote. We need to keep resources flowing into this campaign to ensure our funding for these operations doesn\u2019t run dry. Your $5 or $10 contribution, in addition to your vote, is needed to help us secure more votes. Please chip in anything you can, and let\u2019s win this thing! Let's Flip New Mexico RED! Thank you, Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Where every worker has the freedom to join a union.Where every person has affordable health care, child care, and paid leave.Where every senior can retire with dignity. But Donald Trump and his extremistRepublican allies want to take our country backward. They intend to cut SocialSecurity and Medicare, to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporationsand to make working families foot the bill, and end the Affordable Care Act.America has tried these failed policies before. We are not going back.Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, the batonis in our hands. To protect the right to vote. To get assault weapons off ofour streets. To restore reproductive freedom, reversing Donald Trump's extremeabortion bans. Jacky Rosen is running for reelection to continue deliveringfor Nevadans. In the Senate, she has never hesitated to take on powerfulspecial interests to bring down costs for hardworking Nevada families.

Before I ran for office, I askedmyself that same question. The answer is absolutely, yes! Here\u2019s exactly what$5 can buy a campaign to reach voters: * 250 digital ad impressions * 8 piecesof mail * 10 doors canvassed (you can increase this number by volunteering!)In many close races, voter turnout will determine the final outcome. Campaignsare in high-gear trying to get as many supporters as they can to the polls.Voter contact efforts, made possible by your $5 donation, remind people what\u2019sat stake and how important it is for them to make their voices heard. TheHouse majority could be determined by just a few competitive races here inCalifornia, which is why I\u2019m doing everything I can to help folks like DaveMin, Will Rollins, and Derek Tran win\u2014from financial resources to supportingtheir Get Out The Vote events.

Next door to our district in AZ-01, Dr. Amish Shah has the chance to finally beat David Schweikert and flip a critical battleground seat blue. Schweikert is a MAGA die-hard who helped write the Trump tax cuts, which gave billionaires and big corporations a $1.9 trillion tax break. He's also an anti-choice fanatic who once said that women who have abortions \"hate our country.\" And in AZ-06, Kirsten Engel is running to flip a seat that went red by just 5,232 votes in 2022.

RUSH MY DONATION Last time around, Ted Cruzwon his race by just over 2% of the vote \u2013 that was a difference of about215,000 votes, Peter. I remember how it felt watching the results roll in onNovember 6, 2018, and let me tell you, it was a nail-biter. I have no doubtsthat this year will be when we finally send Ted Cruz packing. But despitebeing closer than ever to defeating Ted, we've still got a lot more work to doand only a handful of days left to do it. I know seeing a number like $3million can feel overwhelming, but if thousands of hardworking folks like youchip in $5 here, $25 there, and the occasional $100, we will be able tocollectively reach this critical goal. So please, will you chip in a splitdonation between my campaign and Defeat Boebert PAC of $10 or whatever you canafford now so I can hit my final end-of-month goal and flip Texas blue?

With Election Dayaround the corner, right now is the most critical time to surge support forEMILYs List women up and down the ballot. Let me explain: Over the past month,I've been on the ground in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, and a few other keystates. I've talked to voters, candidates, and volunteers all across thecountry. And I can tell you firsthand that the polls and the pundits areright: our women's races will be close. There's a saying in politics, belovedby fundraisers and field organizers alike: the margin of effort. When thepolls are tight, and a race could go either way, what matters most is theheart, grit, and commitment of the supporters. If we put in the work, we'llwin. If we don't, we won't. It's that simple. Critical races like VP KamalaHarris', Sen. Tammy Baldwin's (WI-SEN), and Rep. Susan Wild's (PA-07) now fallsquarely within the margin of effort. And your support can help make sure wereach as many voters as possible before Nov. 5. Let's give it all we've got,Peter.

But this year, Kirsten is facing an incredibly tough fight at the ballot box. Democrats are defending a massive 23 seats, meaning our grassroots resources are spread incredibly thin. And in 2022, New York saw the biggest red wave across the country. Now, those same extremists are working overtime to defeat Kirsten and retake control of the Senate. There's no way Kirsten backs down from this fight. But I also know exactly what it's going to take to win this election and defend our razor-thin Senate majority: Strong grassroots investments from people like you. That's why I'm personally asking \u2014 can you make a donation before midnight tonight to help my friend Kirsten defend her must-win seat and protect our Senate majority? Trust me, this is the only way that Kirsten will win. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_fr_defend-senate-2024?refcode=jtk5593-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 In everything that she does \u2014 every fight that she takes on, every piece of legislation that she supports, and every constituent that she advocates for \u2014 Kirsten is absolutely relentless. That's what makes her such an incredible advocate for Americans around the country (and one of the most powerful allies that you can have here in the Senate). Now, more than ever, New Yorkers, Democrats, and all Americans need Kirsten's bold voice in Congress. Because today, our most fundamental rights are under unprecedented attack from extremist Republicans. We're in a national emergency for our democracy and all of the values we hold dear. Kirsten and I are fighting every day to safeguard these rights. We're working to pass voting rights legislation that will ensure every single American has equal, unrestricted access to the ballot box. And we're rallying support to certify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would give us a legal basis to restore reproductive rights nationwide. But to continue these fights, and save our Senate majority, Kirsten needs your help: The only way to defeat the GOP's megadonors is with strong grassroots support from folks like you. So please, friend, if you have anything to spare today, will you rush a donation now to help Kirsten protect her seat so that we can continue to fight for your family in the Senate? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_fr_defend-senate-2024?refcode=jtk5593-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for all that you do, Sen.

But hell, if you wantto click here and chip in right away, I'm not gonna stop you.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?amounts=250,100,50,25,5&refcode;=jtk3725-fr-text I'll get right into it:Democrats have a razor-thin Senate majority, and we're facing a NIGHTMARESenate map. There's a strong chance it will all come down to Ohio, which meansSherrod is the ONLY thing standing between us and a Republican Senate. Friend,I've worked on campaigns for a long time. I've been on the winning side andthe losing side. If there's one thing I know, it's that money makes a BIGdifference. I wish it weren't the case, but it is. TV ads, phone banks, yardsigns, campaign events in every corner of the state \u2013 it all adds up FAST.That's why I'm so terrified right now. If this were a simple battle betweengood and evil, I wouldn't be worried \u2013 Sherrod is as good a leader as Ohioanshave ever had. He fights harder for workers than anybody I know, and he's notafraid to take on the big banks and corporations that are making things harderfor the middle class. But money muddies the waters, and his opponent has got aton of it. He's poured A TON into his own campaign, and there's a lot morewhere that came from. Sherrod simply doesn't have that kind of money \u2013 sothat's where this grassroots team needs to come in and have his back, friend.I know Sherrod can win this critical race and keep the Senate blue, but ONLYIF we all come together to give him the resources he needs. So I'm asking:Will you rush $5, $25, or even $50 to help him win in Ohio and defend ourSenate majority? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?amounts=250,100,50,25,5&refcode;=jtk3725-fr-text Thanks for doingyour part \u2013 there's simply no other option if we want to save the Senate! \u2013James Carville -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

Instead of telling voters about any actual accomplishmentduring his time in the Senate or his vision for the future, Hawley spewed thesame lies about me that he\u2019s spent millions of dollars to air on TV sinceAugust. And that says a lot. He doesn\u2019t want to talk about his career-longcrusade to restrict reproductive freedoms like abortion, birth control, andIVF.

Six days from rightnow, voters will decide the future of America. I'm looking at the early votetotals and I'll be completely upfront with you\u2026 I'm beyond worried. I'mpetrified. The Democrat voter turnout/ballot harvesting machine is chargingfull speed ahead to rob Donald Trump of the presidency, steal the House, andhold the line in the Senate. At this point, we could wake up on November 6thto a full Democrat takeover of America. That's why President Trump and I areworking hand in glove to save the country.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bI'm campaigning on stage with him. I'm traveling to swing states like Michiganto turn out voters. And I'm rallying Republican voters in Tennessee and beyondto win. The only problem is I'm about $80,000 short of my fundraising goalright now. I'm scared that if I don't make up the lost ground, I'll have toshut down our voter turnout operation for the final stretch of the election. Ididn't want to burden you with this but I'm out of options. I'm forced to cometo you - with my hat in hand - to plead with you for help. If you can spareeven a few dollars, it would mean a great deal to me.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bCONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT If you canhttps://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bpitch in $100 - $250, it would make a huge dent in my budget shortfall andchange everything.

If every Conservative gave at leastthis much, the Democrats would be out of power for a generation. All I ask isthat you donate something before Election Day.

These justices and their MAGA pals Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas have gutted the EPA, slashed voting rights, and overturned Roe v. Wade. This far-right majority doesn\u2019t represent the values of the majority of Americans, so it\u2019s past time we ensured the court wasn\u2019t a cesspool of MAGA extremists. That\u2019s why President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to enact term limits for justices is so critical. Instead of having a MAGA majority for decades, we could at regular intervals nominate justices who aren\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s hand-picked weirdos! This plan is incredible for democracy and reproductive rights, but it will need a groundswell of support if we are going to get it done. Will you sign our petition today demanding that Congress pass Joe Biden\u2019s Supreme Court term limits plan? We need every single local Democrat to sign if we are going to have enough momentum to save our country from this extreme Supreme Court!

There\u2019s NO WAY we can allow Harris or Heinrich to continue failing us in Washington, D.C., and I need your help to defeat them and their radical agenda here in New Mexico. I am ready to get to work on DAY ONE with Pres. Trump to secure our borders and fix what the left has broken. We\u2019re so close to the finish line, and I need your help to get across. Please rush $10 or more to help us keep fighting every minute all the way until the end, when we\u2019ve flipped this seat, secured the Senate, and ensured we have the ability to get our country back on track. Thank you, Nella Domenici Help Elect Nella and Secure the Border \u00bb ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

The onlything left that Debbie needs to win is a sizable grassroots cash infusion overthe last 5 days \u2014 especially before her last $10 million end-of-month deadlinetonight.

From the earliest days of thiselection cycle, you've been the driving force behind our efforts to grow theHouse Majority.  As Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, I've had theprivilege of traveling the country, working with our candidates, and seeingyour impact firsthand. Your generosity has allowed us to build a top-notchteam, craft cutting-edge campaigns, and fight the Democrat machine.  But I know that our success isn't just about House Republicans - **it's aboutthe countless hours you've volunteered, your thoughtful survey responses, andthe contributions you've given to fuel our movement. You're the unsung hero ofour party, and I'm honored to stand alongside you in this fight.**  Now, as we sprint to the finish line, I need your help one more time if youcan spare a few dollars.  **We're facing a fierce battle in the final days of this election, and everydollar counts. That's why I'm humbly asking you to make a final contributionto help defend our razor-thin House Majority.**  Your donation will go directly towards our Get Out the Vote efforts,advertising, and other key pieces of our campaign operation.

A recent, A+ poll shows that we\u2019re statistically tied with Rick Scott.He\u2019s spent millions on TV ads attacking me, and he still can\u2019t pull ahead.I\u2019ve said it all along: Florida is in play. We can win this race. I know it,Floridians know it, and Rick Scott knows it too. That\u2019s why he and his superPAC are spending millions of dollars every week attacking me and trying to buyhis Senate seat again. He spent $10.5 million on new ads, and he just infusedhis campaign with another $3 MILLION from his own corrupt fortune. This raceis so close \u2014 and with this grassroots movement, we can retire creepy Rick forgood. But I need you with me. My LAST fundraising deadline of the Election isjust days away, friend.

Ithought that would be the end of the damage\u2026 But with the election rightaround the corner, Kamala\u2019s Deep State truly wants to ruin me with all they\u2019vegot. They\u2019re now considering dealing one final blow to me. A judge may noworder me to give up my remaining home in Florida \u2013 my primary residence. As mylawyer inquired: do they truly want me homeless? Over the last few days, we\u2019veheard ridiculous claims about President Trump being a \u201cfascist.\u201d Let me tellyou what fascism is\u2026 Fascism is weaponizing the legal system to punish yourpolitical opponents. Fascism is having your home taken from you. Fascism istaking the law license away from your opponent\u2019s lawyer. Fascism is trying toturn your enemies into political prisoners. I am living through theDemocrats\u2019 fascism right now. I sincerely pray that freedom, justice, and thetruth prevail on Tuesday, November 5 \u2013 or the damage done to me will spreadlike wildfire to the rest of our great Republic. But, as I wrote to you in anearlier letter, the Bible reminds us that our earthly possessions will alwaysfade, but greater \u201cheavenly treasures\u201d await us. The pursuit of truth,freedom, and justice are worth infinitely more than a car or a home.Possessions come and go, but I couldNEVER SURRENDER my fight for freedom andfor what I know to betrue. I would be tone deaf if I didn\u2019t acknowledge thattimes are tough right now for all Americans, not just me, so please stopreading here if you cannot give at this time. But funding my Legal DefenseTrust is my last remaining hope of fighting for my freedom and for the libertyand justice of all Americans. So, if you can, and, seriously, only if you can,please make a contribution to my Legal Defense Trust \u2013 the Rudy GiulianiFreedom Fund \u2013 as I keep fighting for my freedom and justice as Kamala\u2019s DeepState tries to JAIL me for life.

From the earliest days of thiselection cycle, you've been the driving force behind our efforts to grow theHouse Majority.  As Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, I've had theprivilege of traveling the country, working with our candidates, and seeingyour impact firsthand. Your generosity has allowed us to build a top-notchteam, craft cutting-edge campaigns, and fight the Democrat machine.  But I know that our success isn't just about House Republicans - **it's aboutthe countless hours you've volunteered, your thoughtful survey responses, andthe contributions you've given to fuel our movement. You're the unsung hero ofour party, and I'm honored to stand alongside you in this fight.**  Now, as we sprint to the finish line, I need your help one more time if youcan spare a few dollars.  **We're facing a fierce battle in the final days of this election, and everydollar counts. That's why I'm humbly asking you to make a final contributionto help defend our razor-thin House Majority.**  Your donation will go directly towards our Get Out the Vote efforts,advertising, and other key pieces of our campaign operation.

UnlikeRick Scott, I don't have a massive fortune at my campaign's disposal. I comefrom a working-class family, so I know my eye-watering $4 million goal isnothing to shake a stick at. But it's the only way I'll be able to defeat him.If that's all you need to hear, please click here to chip in $10 now \u2014 but I'dlike to share what your hard-earned $10 means to me.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text See, my family moved to the United States from Ecuador with big dreamsfor a better life when I was 14. But it didn't come easy, and despite my momworking back-to-back double shifts, we still struggled to afford rent on ourone room apartment. So once I turned 15, I began taking early morning shiftsat a doughnut shop before school. It wasn't much, but the extra cash gave myfamily room to breathe, and eventually, the life we dreamt of finally cametrue. But I'm not the only one who got their start in the doughnut business.When he was a young man, my opponent, Rick Scott, bought two doughnut shops.While I made minimum wage to help keep the lights on at home, he reaped thebenefits of his employees' hard work. For me, those $10 boxes of doughnutswere a lifeline that helped my family get by. For him, they kicked off acareer in penthouse C-suites. And with your $10, you can help me kick Rick outof the Senate on election night \u2014 so please, pitch in now.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text I went on to graduate college, fight to improve life for working familieslike my own, and become the first South American immigrant elected toCongress. Rick Scott went on to enrich himself off U.S. taxpayers via thelargest Medicare fraud scheme in history, amass a nine-figure fortune, and buyhis way into the Senate. So I don't take your help toward reaching my $4million goal lightly. There's simply no way I could ever do it on my own. Myopponent, however, can spend $4 million to get his ads on screens withoutthinking twice \u2014 and he has already spent plenty more to stop me. So the onlyway we'll get him out and give working Floridians the Senate representation wedeserve is if we hit my $4 million goal. Please, friend: Will you give just$10 \u2014 about the cost of a dozen doughnuts \u2014 to help me retire Rick Scott?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text This campaign is powered by small-dollar donations, so every cent makes abig difference.

Can I count on you to step up with a split donation of $10 today to ensure my team and I have the resources we need to push back against the $40 million worth of attack ads Ted Cruz and his allies are running against us right now? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Last time around, Ted Cruz won his race by just over 2% of the vote \u2013 that was a difference of about 215,000 votes, friend. I remember how it felt watching the results roll in on November 6, 2018, and let me tell you, it was a nail-biter. I have no doubts that this year will be when we finally send Ted Cruz packing. But despite being closer than ever to defeating Ted, we've still got a lot more work to do and only a handful of days left to do it. I know seeing a number like $500,000 can feel overwhelming, but if thousands of hardworking folks like you chip in $5 here, $25 there, and the occasional $100, we will be able to collectively reach this critical goal. So please, will you chip in a split donation between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's of $10 or whatever you can afford now so I can hit my daily fundraising goal and flip Texas blue? We've got zero time left to go, so let's get it done, friend! https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thanks for being on my team, Colin Allred -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

THEN: Trumpunleashed a new wave of attacks against Jacky Rosen and planned a massive MAGArally with Jacky\u2019s extreme opponent to shore up support and seal the deal inNevada. NOW: The biggest super PAC for Senate Republicans is spending over $6MILLION in Nevada in just the final days of this race to blindside JackyRosen\u2019s campaign and pummel her with deceptive attack ads in the final stretchof the election. We\u2019re already walking a tightrope, and this new GOP ad buy isthrowing us completely off balance. Polling already shows Jacky Rosen losingground to her Trump-endorsed opponent, and we need to take immediate action orwe could fall into too deep of a hole to climb out of before Election Day.Please, if we don\u2019t respond TODAY, these ads could wreck months of hard workright when we need our momentum the most. We need to raise AT LEAST $250,000today to fend off this Republican ad blitz.

My team just let me know that we came up short of our October fundraising goal last night. This was always going to be an uphill battle. We had to raise our goals multiple times throughout the month to keep up with the tens of millions of dollars Republicans continue to spend on brutal attack ads against me. Now, I won\u2019t tell you that the sky is falling because we missed this goal. But I will tell you the truth, which is that we\u2019re starting November with a significant gap in our budget. That\u2019s a problem because if we need to cut back on our campaign ads or get-out-the-vote efforts this late in the race, Republicans could easily flip this battleground seat. Staying competitive in this toss-up race isn\u2019t as easy for me as tapping into a multimillion-dollar personal fortune like my opponent can. Instead, I rely on folks like you who pitch in what you can, when you can, to help power our campaign.

Bernie Moreno GOPNominee for Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fights for theAmerican Dream because he\u2019s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota, Colombia. Atage five, his American Dream began when he moved to the United States with hisfamily. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Through his relentlesswork ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned the first cardealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largest dealership groupsin America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value and transformationalpotential of blockchain technology, before it received mainstream attention,and moved much of his volunteer time and investment dollars into the space. In2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to be quite successful as Bernieserved as Chairman of the Board. After a long, successful career, Bernie soldmost of his business to begin focusing on his calling: protecting the Americandream for another generation. Solving our country\u2019s problems requires commonsense. In Washington, Bernie will fight to shrink government, protect ourfreedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party from taking our data and land, andalways put America First. Ohioans are done with politicians who talk a biggame and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. to get work done \u2013 just likehe always has.

We all know it. The only people who can afford to runfor Senate full-time are millionaires like my opponent, Republican DebFischer. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the only people who ever win. It\u2019s why the Senateis just another country club full of Ivy League graduates, former businessexecs, and trust fund babies. Working people like me, we can\u2019t afford to giveup our jobs to run for office. During this campaign, I\u2019ve been working 40, 60,sometimes 90 hours a week as a steamfitter just to pay our bills and put foodon the table. How\u2019s anybody with a real job supposed to campaign and win whenyour opponent is wealthy enough to not work at all? That\u2019s why I announcedthat I was taking a leave from my job as a steamfitter to campaign full-timefor the U.S. Senate and keep up our momentum. And yes, that means I\u2019m going toneed to take a salary from our campaign. Not a big one. Just enough to replacethe $48,000 I got paid last year and the cost of health care for me and myfamily. Politics shouldn\u2019t only be for the rich, and this is the only way wecan change that. Five brand-new polls show me narrowly LEADING my opponent,Republican Deb Fischer \u2013 and according to FiveThirtyEight, this is now theCLOSEST Senate race in the country.

        "body": "Friend, I\u2019ve got about half a century of politics under my belt, so you cantrust me when I say this: Rick Scott poses one of the single greatest threatsto our democracy and everything that we Democrats care about \u2014 full stop. NowI\u2019m known for making some pretty bold statements, but this is no exaggeration:Rick Scott is pushing an agenda so extreme, even Mitch McConnell wants nothingto do with it. I\u2019m talking about ending Social Security and Medicare, raisingtaxes on working families, a national ban on abortions, and so much more. I\u2019mscared half to death thinking about what could happen if we give this guy 6more years in Washington \u2014 especially with MAGA extremists on the cusp ofretaking the Senate. But right now, Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is fallingdangerously short of her LAST $4 million fundraising goal ahead of ElectionDay. I\u2019m asking you to take the gloves off and go on the offensive with me:Please, will you donate $5 or more to help Debbie flip Florida blue and saveour Senate majority?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2463-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Listen, just about anyone can see that a bluewave is building in Florida. As folks from all across the state rally behindDebbie\u2019s campaign, polling data shows that this race against extremist RickScott is a dead heat. And that barely scratches the surface: Even with theextreme abortion ban officially in effect, Florida Democrats secured areproductive rights ballot initiative this November and won a critical specialelection, flipping a pivotal state House district from red to blue. That\u2019s whyDemocratic leaders like my friend Chuck Schumer, and even President Biden, areall in on Florida this year. They\u2019ve announced HUGE investments to make surethat voters learn the truth about Rick Scott\u2019s record. This state is ready toflip blue \u2014 but we\u2019ve all got to have Debbie\u2019s back in this fight. So I\u2019masking one final time: PLEASE, will you donate $5 or as much as you can spareright now to make sure that Debbie has everything that she needs to take onRick Scott and defeat him?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2463-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for taking the time to read thisemail. Debbie can win, but only if folks like you believe in her and invest inher campaign. James Carville -------- This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.

The outcome of November\u2019s election will shape the trajectory of ourlives, impacting our families, our economy, and our national security foryears to come.

Radical Democrats like Slotkin are selling Michigan out to foreigninterests, crippling our auto industry, and hiking up the cost of living \u2014putting a strain on every American living paycheck to paycheck. Under theHarris-Slotkin agenda, hardworking families are struggling to make ends meet.Meanwhile, I\u2019ve spent my entire career defending this country, serving as anofficer in the U.S. Army and a Special Agent in the FBI, and working inCongress to protect American workers and fight for your values.

This is one of thebiggest elitist bankrollers of Sherrod Brown, Kamala Harris, and the DNC. Thisis who Sherrod is beholden to and who he has to comply with in order tocontinue having his campaign war chest padded. Brown, Harris, and the radicalleft have shown us their true colors. They think those of us who disagree withthem \u2013half the country \u2013 are deplorable, Nazi garbage... and worse! It\u2019s timeto put an end to their hateful and destructive hold on our nation.

For American Greatness!Bernie Moreno GOP Nominee for Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Morenofights for the American Dream because he\u2019s lived it. Bernie was born inBogota, Colombia. At age five, his American Dream began when he moved to theUnited States with his family. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18.Through his relentless work ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, heturned the first car dealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of thelargest dealership groups in America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value andtransformational potential of blockchain technology, before it receivedmainstream attention, and moved much of his volunteer time and investmentdollars into the space. In 2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to bequite successful as Bernie served as Chairman of the Board. After a long,successful career, Bernie sold most of his business to begin focusing on hiscalling: protecting the American dream for another generation. Solving ourcountry\u2019s problems requires common sense. In Washington, Bernie will fight toshrink government, protect our freedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party fromtaking our data and land, and always put America First. Ohioans are done withpoliticians who talk a big game and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. toget work done \u2013 just like he always has.

We are proud to be supporting the work to passthat constitutional amendment as well as the woman who is running to unseatWebster Barnaby. As you may recall, Barnaby is responsible for introducing the6-week, Texas-style abortion ban in FL in the first place. We are excited toshare our endorsement of Rosemarie Latham for Florida House District 29.Polling shows that Rosemarie is closer to winning this race against herextremist, anti-choice opponent (within 3 points!!) than anyone could haveexpected.

Republican state Rep.Webster Barnaby filed the 40-page proposal \u2014 called the \"Florida HeartbeatAct\" \u2014 on Wednesday. It would prevent physicians from performing abortions ifthere is a \"detectable fetal heartbeat,\" effectively banning abortions afterabout six weeks into pregnancy, before many people even know they arepregnant. ] We have said it before and we\u2019ll say it again: MEN SHOULD NOT BEMAKING LAWS ABOUT WOMEN\u2019S BODIES! Rosemarie is a single mother of daughters.She has been a nurse for 43 years, and a nurse practitioner for 25 years. Shehas decades of experience caring for women 16 and over, including providingthem with reproductive healthcare. Through this experience, she has directlyengaged in the triumphs and challenges of our healthcare system and has seenthe ripple effect on people\u2019s lives. \u201cThe exam room isn\u2019t big enough to fitme, my patient, and Florida\u2019s government.\u201d This is why Rosemarie chose to runfor office. Because she is determined to do everything she can for women\u2019shealth and safety. The same cannot be said about her opponent. We are sick andtired of men making dangerous laws about our bodies and our lives. We areworking hard to restore abortion access in Florida. A critical step in thatprocess will be to unseat the men who worked to pass abortion bans and replacethem with fiercely pro choice women.

Will you chip in $5 or moretoday to Blue Amp Action so we can support Democratic candidates who willprotect LGBTQ+ rights and make sure that MAGA Republicans can\u2019t use theirpower to harm marginalized groups? --- | | DONATE --- | **Republicans are going mask off about** their desire to see protectionsfor LGBTQ+ people stripped away. Project 2025 \u2013 which will no doubt serve asthe blueprint for a Trump presidency \u2013 calls for eliminating sexualorientation and gender identity as protected classes which leaves LGBTQ+people without a legal safeguard from discrimination. We can\u2019t let far-righthardliners win on Tuesday and implement their dangerous Project 2025 agenda \u2013but we\u2019re running out of time to guarantee Democrats will win big and keepLGBTQ+ rights SAFE. So please, Peter, can we count on you to make a gift toBlue Amp Action today so we can invest in Democrats before it\u2019s too late? --- | --- | | | | | | DONATE --- | Thank you. \\- Blue Amp Action --- | --- | | |  --- | --- | | |  --- | | | | |  --- | | | ![](https://default.salsalabs.org/45e0a77d-b3d0-4896-b6c7-fc1b02fe5cac/bdd7c5f5-7de1-4347-b64e-b4284329efec.png) | Cliff Schecter President, Blue Amp Action Amplify Good  ---|--- | | |  --- | | Follow Us | ![](https://blueampstrategies.salsalabs.org/public/images/icons/medium-auto_twitter2.png) | ![](https://blueampstrategies.salsalabs.org/public/images/icons/medium-auto_linkedin.png) ---|---  | **Blue Amp Action PAC** PO Box 8384, Cincinnati, OH 45208 --- | Having trouble viewing this email? View it in your web browser --- | | |  --- | | | About BlueAmp Action: We cannot sugarcoat the current situation. Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day. So our kids grow up in democracy, not dystopia. Thank you for your support for all we do!

For American Greatness!Bernie Moreno GOP Nominee for Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Morenofights for the American Dream because he\u2019s lived it. Bernie was born inBogota, Colombia. At age five, his American Dream began when he moved to theUnited States with his family. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18.Through his relentless work ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, heturned the first car dealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of thelargest dealership groups in America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value andtransformational potential of blockchain technology, before it receivedmainstream attention, and moved much of his volunteer time and investmentdollars into the space. In 2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to bequite successful as Bernie served as Chairman of the Board. After a long,successful career, Bernie sold most of his business to begin focusing on hiscalling: protecting the American dream for another generation. Solving ourcountry\u2019s problems requires common sense. In Washington, Bernie will fight toshrink government, protect our freedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party fromtaking our data and land, and always put America First. Ohioans are done withpoliticians who talk a big game and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. toget work done \u2013 just like he always has.

Your support will allow us to send money where it\u2019s needed most,combat misinformation, and show Trump once and for all that the Americanpeople REJECT him and his extremist views.

Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day.

So I wanted to take a few minutes to tell you about my decision to run for president \u2013 and why your support for the DLCC and my campaign is so important to our success on Election Day in four days. Before I continue, if you\u2019re short on time, will you split a donation between the DLCC and my campaign at my personal link below? https://dlcc.org/dlcc-hfp **The truth is: I am no stranger to unlikely journeys.** Where I grew up in the Bay, you either live in the hills or the flatlands. We lived in the flats. It was a working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the civil rights movement, and at a young age I decided I wanted to be a lawyer. I wanted to protect people because I believe everyone has a right to safety, dignity, and justice. Today, my decision to run for president has everything to do with this opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past. We have the chance to chart a new way forward \u2013 not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans. I want you to know that I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens, who is realistic, practical, and has common sense. A president who always fights for the American people. I cannot do it alone. No one person could. It takes a team. It takes millions and millions of people coming together at once to shape the outcome of this election and elect Democrats up and down the ballot. If we are going to win this election and elect Democrats in swing districts across our country, I need you to step up and join this team. Millions of Americans have already voted, and millions more will vote on Election Day. And we need to do everything we can \u2013 and I mean everything \u2013 to reach every last voter to win the White House and elect Democrats to state legislatures across the country. **So, with time running out to make an impact before Election Day, I am asking for your support one last time:** Will you help us get out the vote over these final days by splitting $10, or whatever you can afford, between the DLCC and my campaign before our midnight deadline? Every dollar will help us reach more voters and elect Democrats in key swing districts before the polls close on Election Day. | If you've stored your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately and be split between DLCC PAC and the Harris-Walz campaign.  --- | $10 \u00bb --- | $25 \u00bb --- | $50 \u00bb --- | $100 \u00bb --- | $250 \u00bb --- | Other \u00bb ---  From the bottom of my heart: Thank you for everything.

        "body": "[http://adamforcolorado.com]http://adamforcolorado.com[http://adamforcolorado.com] Hello, The day before the anniversary of theSupreme Court\u2019s disastrous Dobbs decision, I woke up to Fox News and LaurenBoebert attacking my sister and my 81-year-old father. For decades, Dad was anOB-GYN. He delivered thousands of babies and wrote books on how to getpregnant and to navigate menopause. Dad provided women with full access to allkinds of reproductive health care, including abortions, in the years rightafter Roe \u2013 and he has now had to watch as women\u2019s reproductive rights aregutted in the aftermath of Dobbs . Dad and his clinic faced many threats overthe years. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that he put his own safety \u2013 and thatof his family \u2013 at risk in order to protect the rights of women to make theirown medical decisions. But I\u2019m not sure he ever expected to see a sittingmember of Congress attacking him \u2013 or my sister who followed in his footsteps\u2013 in a national news outlet. It\u2019s disgusting. These kinds of personal attacksagainst my family have no place in our politics and do nothing to serve thepeople of Western and Southern Colorado. If extremists like Lauren Boebert andmy new Republican opponent want to have a conversation about reproductiverights in this country, I am more than happy to have that debate. We can talkabout how I support freedom and liberty \u2013 and how they support big governmentintruding into the lives of women. We can talk about how they support anational ban on abortion \u2013 with no exceptions for rape, incest, or the life ofthe mother. And we can talk about how they are so extreme, they even want toban the pill that\u2019s been used by women for decades. I am willing to talk allday about the fringe view that the government should be dictating women\u2019smedical decisions. But what I won\u2019t accept is extremists like Lauren Boebertand Fox News attacking my father and my sister. I am incredibly proud of myfather. He provided health care to women when they needed it during some ofthe happiest \u2013 and most devastating \u2013 moments of their lives. Beforeretirement, he would drive two hours to Planned Parenthood and help teach thenext generation of health care providers, like my sister. And no one \u2013 not FoxNews, and especially not extremists like Lauren Boebert or my new Republicanopponent \u2013 is going to stop my family from continuing to stand up for awoman\u2019s right to choose. We already scared off Lauren Boebert. In 2022, I camejust 546 votes shy of winning this House seat. I\u2019m ready to finish the job andreplace Boebert in Congress, but these are the kinds of ugly attacks that I\u2019mup against. Please, if you can afford to, will you give $5 or more right nowto my campaign to help me win this critical House seat? Our race was theclosest in the entire country in 2022. But I\u2019m not taking money from corporatePACs, so I\u2019m counting on grassroots donors like you if I\u2019m going to win.[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=10&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=25&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=35&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=50&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=100&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]I knew this campaign was going to get nasty, but I never expected the otherside to go after my family.

But before we do, here\u2019s aquick rundown of where we are right now: 1. There are only 4 days left untilvoters go out to the polls. 2. 3. From the White House to down-ballot races,polls show that Democrats are in a dead heat to win the presidency and bothCongressional chambers. 4. 5. If Democrats win across the board, Kamala Harrisand Tim Walz will be able to effectively govern and bring all Americans on anew path forward. 6. 7.

We\u2019ve got an incredible candidate for Senate. We\u2019ve gotcompetitive congressional districts across the Commonwealth. And we\u2019ve got theenergy on the ground to make those victories happen \u2014 if we act. Virginiaisn\u2019t just our surprise swing state this year. The roads to majorities inCongress could very well run right through Virginia. >>> LET\u2019S WIN VIRGINIA<<< That\u2019s why I\u2019m mobilizing resources online and on the road to reach votersand turn Virginia red in these final days. To support these efforts, we\u2019rerunning an urgent end-of-month fundraising surge to power us through ElectionDay.

Please, pitch in anything you can. >>> CHIP IN TO OURFINAL PUSH FUND NOW <<< Thank you, Jason Miyares Virginia Attorney GeneralWHO IS JASON MIYARES AND WHY IS HE WRITING TO ME? Jason Miyares is theAttorney General of Virginia \u2014 but his story doesn\u2019t start in Virginia\u2026 Itstarts in Havana, Cuba, when his mother, Miriam Miyares, fled communist Cubapenniless and homeless. She immigrated to Virginia and raised Jason toappreciate freedom, fairness, and justice for all. In 2015, almost fifty yearsto the day that she fled Cuba, Miriam was able to vote for Jason to representher in the Virginia House of Delegates. After working as a prosecutor andserving for three terms in the state legislature, he ran and was elected the48th Attorney General of Virginia. Since his inauguration in January 2022,Jason has been focused on fighting violent crime and improving public safety,strengthening economic growth, combatting the deadly impact of opioids andfentanyl, and protecting Virginians from corporate misconduct. He\u2019s beenfearless in standing up for the rule of law by challenging the Biden-HarrisAdministration whenever it tries to use lawfare to advance its radical agenda,whether it\u2019s failing to secure the border or advancing its extreme greenagenda. This year, he\u2019s not on the ballot \u2014 but the American Miracle is. JasonMiyares is laser-focused on making sure that we win Virginia this year, andthat\u2019s why he\u2019s writing to you today.Will you join Jason\u2019s team and help himturn Virginia red?

If you\u2019re way too online like me, you\u2019ve probably seen a tonof headlines about a bunch of rich guys running for Senate in states wherethey don't even live.

But this will be one ofthe toughest races of the year for Democrats. McCormick has millions uponmillions of dollars of his own to dump into this race, in addition to thebacking of Donald Trump and billionaire-funded super PACs. Pennsylvania is ascompetitive as it gets, and with the Senate majority and the White Housedepending on it, we can\u2019t take anything for granted.

Here's why: *Ohioans are already voting, and Election Day is next week \u2013 so the sooner wecan launch this final ad, the more voters we'll be able to reach before theysubmit their ballots. * We're getting drowned out on the airwaves \u2013Republicans have outspent us 3-to-1, so this final ad will punch back at theirattacks. * This final ad is going to be expensive \u2013 and we're going to run iton as many TV stations across Ohio as possible, so the more we raise, thebetter the chance we have at reaching the voters we need before Election Day.So, my team and I have set an urgent goal to raise $500,000 before midnighttomorrow to help launch this ad \u2013 my last ad before Election Day.

As the lead counsel in Trump\u2019s first impeachment in 2019, I saw first-hand that democratic ideals, values and institutions are perceived by Trump as an obstacle, not an asset. But I never imagined five years ago that he would go this far. And it is certain to get worse if he wins. Before I continue, please consider pitching in any amount in the final stretch of this election. Our vital work to defend our democracy and the rule of law is more important now than ever.

As lead counsel for the Democrats during Trump\u2019s first impeachment, I helped to expose Donald Trump and his lawlessness to the American people. We proved that a corrupt president had abused the power of his office to undermine our democratic process in a bid to stay in power. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dsg-em-nov24 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dsg-em-nov24] But that abuse of power was just the tip of the iceberg. Since then, Trump has attempted to overturn a lawful election in 2020, been indicted four times and convicted of 34 felony counts for interfering in the 2016 election, used his office to make money from foreign countries, cozied up to dictators, and tried everything in his power to undermine checks and balances and the separation of powers. But his plans for a second presidency are so much more dangerous. He has stated that he\u2019d like to be a dictator, that he will use the military and the Department of Justice against anyone who disagrees with him, that he will turn the federal government into his personal fiefdom, that he will take away our individual rights and personal freedoms, and that he will support dictators over democracies around the world. Peter, we have unfinished business to save our country from Trump\u2019s authoritarian intentions. Our democracy barely survived the first Trump presidency, and it\u2019s unlikely it would survive a second. I\u2019m running for re-election because we must stop Donald Trump and the Republican Party he controls from tearing down our democracy. And I need your support. Please contribute anything you can to support my work in the last four days of this election. We cannot waste a single second in this existential fight for American democracy.

This will save these candidates a mountain of money, so they can use your contributions to win votes rather than to pay fundraising costs. Here are the Senate candidates who need your urgent support: \u2713 Bernie Moreno (OH) \u2713 Eric Hovde (WI) \u2713 Sam Brown (NV) \u2713 Kari Lake (AZ) Please take action right now by making a split contribution to their conservative Senate campaigns.

It's true. When you respond to marketing emails and text messages from candidates, the candidates often get less than 20 percent of your donation after expenses. That's why the Senate Conservatives Fund was founded \u2013 to give freedom-loving Americans an effective way to support the best Senate candidates across the nation. Please contribute to these four candidates today! We will combine your donations with those made by thousands of other patriots and transfer them directly to their campaigns.

In October of lastyear, Republicans in the state legislature manipulated the maps to gainunearned power. And state supreme court justices acted as ideologues insteadof neutral arbiters of the law \u2014 reversing the court\u2019s own very recentprecedent and allowing those maps to move forward. Shockingly, the currentgerrymandered maps allow Republicans to hold supermajorities in thelegislature even if Democrats win statewide elections. And it\u2019s important toremember that even if Democrats hold the governor\u2019s seat this year, aRepublican supermajority in the legislature can override his veto. You\u2019veprobably heard a lot about the governor\u2019s race in North Carolina thiselection, even if you don\u2019t live there. But here\u2019s the critical North Carolinarace not enough people are talking about: A state supreme court candidate hasopenly said he wants a Republican majority on the court for the upcomingredistricting cycle. He praised North Carolina\u2019s extreme congressionalgerrymander. And he joined a deeply controversial ruling that would haveestablished precedent for so-called personhood laws in North Carolina \u2014 thefoundation for restricting abortion and banning IVF. We are working to defeatcandidates like him in races across the country. Peter, step up with adonation to help ensure the NDRC can do everything we can between today andNovember 5th to elect Democracy Defenders in battleground states.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina] If you've saved your paymentinformation with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:Donate $5 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true&amount;=5]Donate $15 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true&amount;=15]Donate $30 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true&amount;=30]Donate $50 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true&amount;=50]Donate $100 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true&amount;=100]Another amount [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_NorthCarolina_email_20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241101-NDRC-Tier1-NorthCarolina_&utm;_campaign=NorthCarolina&express;_lane=true] Theelection happening in just a few days will help shape the future of fair mapsfor North Carolinians. We\u2019ve proudly endorsed Justice Allison Riggs for theNorth Carolina Supreme Court because she has proven to be a fair-minded andindependent voice on the court. She is a tenacious civil rights attorney whohas been a champion of every American\u2019s fundamental rights, including votingrights. By re-electing Justice Riggs and getting new pro-democracy leaders onthe North Carolina Supreme Court, we can pave the way for fair maps that giveeveryone in the state a fair chance to make their voices heard. And we canstand against GOP gerrymanderers who will keep trying to dilute the will ofthe people. This election is just one of hundreds we\u2019ve identified across thecountry where your support can make an outsized impact to defend ourdemocracy.

Even if you don\u2019t agree with all thedetails, we need to start discussing solutions to the problems that my planwill solve: a dysfunctional welfare system, the looming insolvency of SocialSecurity and Medicare, and our mounting national debt. Right now, I am theonly one even attempting to think about these crucial issues and offering apossible plan. It is of course an ambitious plan, and things will obviouslynot change overnight, and if elected I would only be able to take the firststeps toward the discussions that would lead to such solutions. But with yoursupport, I can start on the work of turning our country around. Without it, wewill have to wait that much longer to have these discussions, and meanwhileour debts will keep increasing, making solutions that much more difficult toimplement.

I\u2019m fired up, Peter! The energy at President Trump\u2019s rally in Albuquerque today was palpable. I could feel it on stage while delivering my own remarks, and it was apparent to anyone who was there todaythat something special is happening in New Mexico. We\u2019re on the cusp of flipping this state red and electing new leadership that will secure our border, lower our cost of living, get tough on crime, improve education, and unleash our abundant natural resources. I need you to keep fighting every single day, every single moment, until the polls close on Tuesday. Our campaign is working 24/7 to reach remaining undecided voters and get out the vote. We need to keep resources flowing into this campaign to ensure our funding for these operations doesn\u2019t run dry. Your $5 or $10 contribution, in addition to your vote, is needed to help us secure more votes. Please chip in anything you can, and let\u2019s win this thing! Let's Flip New Mexico RED! Thank you, Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

The times early voting is available today(Friday) is 8:00 am to 6:00 pm & tomorrow you can early vote during the hoursof 8:00 am to 2:00 pm. If you aren\u2019t sure where early voting happens in yourcounty, you can find out here . One of the most impactful votes you will castis on the THREE State Supreme Court judges on the ballot for retention. Thevoters in Oklahoma are being asked \u201cshould these judges be retained on theOklahoma Supreme Court?\u201d And the answer is NO, they should not be retained!You\u2019ve heard plenty about the Presidential Election, and voting straight partyRepublican will restore our economy, but we MUST get rid of these liberaljudges. All three judges are very liberal (check out the score card made byOCPA scoring their liberal records ) by clicking here , and they were allappointed by Democrat Governors. They\u2019ve constantly legislated from the benchwith their decisions in order to force their liberal agenda on the people ofOklahoma. For more information on these judges & the other judges on theballot please visit OKGOP.com/judges/ . There you can download a pdf to printat home, email to your family & friends, or distribute however you choose.Other groups have now engaged as well encouraging their people to vote NO onthese judges. We can\u2019t afford more years of liberal activist judges forcingtheir leftist agenda on our State. Tell everyone you know to VOTE NO on allthree Oklahoma Supreme Court judges. The easiest way to remember it is: thesethree liberal Supreme Court judges MUST go, so we all must vote NO! Say NO toEdmondson, Gurich, & Kauger. -Team OKGOP -=-=- Paid for by OKGOP and notauthorized by any candidate or candidate's committee. www.OKGOP.com - (405)528-3501. 4031 N.

So please, before my 11:59 p.m. deadline \u2014 will you rush a donation of$5 or more before midnight to defeat Rick Scott and defend our DemocraticSenate majority?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2475-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 This goal means everything, friend. Rick Scottis using his massive fortune to outspend us on the airwaves, and Floridiansare already heading to the ballot box. Hitting this $4 million goal willensure we have the resources to amplify our own ads, fight Rick Scott'sattacks, and reach undecided voters as they cast their ballots. My two minutesare up, so let me conclude with this: I am so grateful for you, friend \u2014 forthis entire team donating an average of $30.95 at a time because you believein the movement we've built. Thank you. Now is when I need you more than ever.So make a donation now \u2014 of $5 or whatever you can spare today \u2014 to flipFlorida blue and save our Democratic Senate majority!https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2475-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you, Debbie -------- This email was sentto dpwillis67@gmail.com.

When I first ran for Congress inWisconsin, no one thought I could win \u2014 especially when an extremely popularchallenger jumped into the race. I remember huddling with one of my staffersat the time, and she said, \u201cWell Tammy, maybe you want to rethink what you\u2019redoing because it\u2019s going to be tough.\u201d I looked her right in the eye andasked, \u201cDo you think I should wait my turn?\u201d The next thing I said was this: Ibelieve that women have to run \u2014 especially when it\u2019s hard \u2014 and not wait ourturn. We can\u2019t wait until we get a tap on our shoulder or we\u2019ll never getanywhere. I ended up winning that race and became the very first woman electedto the House of Representatives from Wisconsin. And it wouldn\u2019t be the lasttime our team would make history. When I ran for U.S. Senate in 2012, anincredible team of grassroots supporters like you fought alongside me \u2014 evenas some people wrote us off. You helped me become the first woman elected tothe chamber from our state and the first openly gay Senator in our nation\u2019shistory. In 2018, despite being a top target for national Republicans andenduring over a year of attacks, you stood with me again, and we won. Time andagain, grassroots supporters like you have helped us defy the odds. The battleto protect my seat this year will be no different, with this race being mytoughest election yet. Eric Hovde and his Republican allies have already spentmore than $51 million to buy this seat and recent polls are showing this racein a dead heat. Protecting this seat won\u2019t be easy, but together, I know wecan defy the odds once again.

Governor SaraRodriguez. I'm reaching out one last time before Election Day with one simplereminder: This is one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.Wisconsin is one of the most important swing states in the country. Our 10electoral votes are some of the most important in the country, and it'scrucial that we deliver them to Kamala Harris on Election Day. And at thestate level, we have a task that's just as important: flipping the statelegislature. The new, fairer maps for this cycle give everyone the chance towin, which makes this the first time in a long time that we can win a majoritythis November. When we win next Tuesday, it'll let Governor Evers and I focuson passing our agenda that truly serves the people of Wisconsin rather thanfighting back against Republican attempts to bully working-classWisconsinites. With just a few days left in this election cycle, it's moreimportant than ever to make your voice heard at the ballot box.

I know you\u2019re probably about to headoffline for the weekend, so I\u2019ll keep this quick: We need to raise $15,000this weekend to support our get out the vote efforts before Election Day. CanI count on you to pitch in and help us hit this final goal?[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/deluzioq42024email?refcode=email_110124_gotv1&amounts;=5,15,25,50,100,250]Donate \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/deluzioq42024email?refcode=email_110124_gotv1&amounts;=5,15,25,50,100,250]If you have a little more time before logging off, let me explain the stakesof this race: National Republicans have made defeating Chris a top priority.They know that the path to winning the House runs right through PA-17, andthey think that this is a toss-up race they can flip. Only 4 House seats standbetween Republicans or Democrats taking back the House. So winning in this keybattleground race puts us on the best track to winning back the House. But weneed to get out Chris\u2019s message and turn out voters before and on ElectionDay. Republicans are attacking Chris\u2019s record, but they\u2019re the ones with theagenda Western PA doesn\u2019t want. Chris\u2019s opponent supports an extreme,nationwide abortion ban, has rallied with election deniers, has voted to gutvoting rights, and wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the choppingblock. The American people don\u2019t want this kind of lunacy, chaos, andextremism. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to keep this seat soChris can continue fighting to defend our freedoms. But if we\u2019re going to beatthese extremists on Tuesday, we need to hit the ground running this weekend,and we need the money to make it happen. This is the last weekend before theelection \u2013 and your last chance to make a real impact in this race.

It\u2019s full of millionaires, formerbusiness execs, lawyers with Ivy League degrees, and trust fund kids born withso many silver spoons in their mouths that they have no idea the reality forworking-class people like me. If I defeat my opponent Republican Senator DebFischer in November, I will be the poorest member of the U.S. Senate. I don\u2019tcome from money, and I\u2019m not rich. I\u2019m a steamfitter and mechanic who works 50and 60 hour weeks to give my kids a better life. I will be the only senatorwithout a college degree. After my wife and I found out we were expecting ababy, I had to drop out and kill my dream of hanging a diploma on the wallbecause my family needed health insurance, diapers, and food on the table. Iwill be the only senator who is a blue-collar, card-carrying, union member.When Kellogg\u2019s tried to cut our benefits and workers\u2019 pay, we risked it all,went on strike, and walked the picket line for 11 weeks through the bittercold Nebraska winter. We won and saved hundreds of good-paying jobs \u2013 before Iwas fired for being the union president who led the strike. There is no onewho represents working-class people like me in the U.S. Senate. Which is whythis is such big news: Five brand-new polls show I am narrowly LEADING myopponent Republican Senator Deb Fischer. And FiveThirtyEight now says this isthe CLOSEST Senate race in the entire country! I\u2019ve taken on a big corporationbefore and won, and now I\u2019m going to defeat one of the most corporate senators\u2013 my opponent Republican Deb Fischer \u2013 and win this Senate seat. But I needyour help to do it. We\u2019ve set a goal of raising another $200,000 before ournext fundraising deadline at midnight tonight, but I\u2019m not taking money fromcorporate PACs like my opponent. If I\u2019m going to defeat Republican Deb Fischerand win this Senate seat, I need grassroots donors like you to give right now:I have nowhere else to turn.

        "text": "The issue of out-of-state contractors being awarded contracts for local infrastructure projects is a common concern among voters and candidates alike. It raises questions about the efficient use of taxpayer funds, support for local economies, and the environmental impact of increased traffic during construction. To address these concerns, I would suggest the following steps:\n1. **Transparency in Bidding Process**: Ensure that the bidding process for infrastructure projects is transparent. This includes publishing the criteria used for evaluating bids and the reasons why a particular bid was selected.\n2. **Local Preference Policies**: Implement policies that give preference to local contractors, provided they meet the required qualifications and can compete on cost and quality with out-of-state contractors.\n3. **Community Impact Assessments**: Conduct thorough assessments of the community impact before awarding contracts. This includes evaluating the economic benefits to the local community, potential traffic disruptions, and environmental considerations.\n4. **Public Engagement**: Engage with the public throughout the project lifecycle. Inform residents about why a particular contractor was chosen, the expected benefits of the project, and any anticipated disruptions.\n5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and update procurement policies to ensure they are effective and responsive to community needs and concerns.\nBy taking these steps, we can work towards a more efficient, transparent, and community-focused approach to infrastructure development that aligns with the interests of voters.",

Look at the Groundbreaking last weekfor I-95 Photo- Tyler Fedor Source [ http://Tyler Fedor/The Stamford Advocate] Yonkers Contracting is based in New York. As an advocate for you, I reachedout to the press - so far, no response from the media. We are glad there aresome infrastructure improvements and most of the funds are federal but shouldwe also look to use Connecticut companies and keep more of the money in ourstate. After all they are federal tax dollars from CT residents as Connecticutonly gets back 70 cents of every federal dollar spent. A vote for me is a votefor transparency.

We see these truckseverywhere every night along the campaign trail when the roads are beingworked on for improvements. The concerns they raise are seeing New YorkLicense plates and why these are not Connecticut trucks. Have you looked into:How are these contracts awarded? If an out-of-state contractor is hired, willit use Connecticut Union Construction workers and other ancillary Connecticutresidents to participate in the construction or are all these workers New Yorkas well? If an out-of-state contractor is hired, will it use local suppliersof various materials or are all these suppliers New York as well? Whether allcontracts are awarded to the lowest bidder? Are local contractors consideredif their bid is slightly higher? How is a contractor rewarded or penalized byits previous project for change order usage as the winners always seem to bethe same? The percentage of payrolls to Connecticut residents (if any)? Thebenefit to local communities and economies in Connecticut if a localcontractor is awarded the contract? The benefits of contractor profits beingre-invested into the local economy rather than exporting profits outside of CTfor the out-of-state contractor and its out-of-state suppliers? AdditionalFees such as fuel surcharges and other distance based issues on logistics? AsClimate Change and Health Hazards associated with slow-moving traffic are alsomajor concerns, are the following also included in the calculation: Theenvironmental impact of greenhouse gas based on travel distance of workers andequipment out of state to the project site? The additional congestion of theworkforce commuting to the construction site and how it will disrupt trafficfor commuters? We have been concerned about the I-95 traffic and thechallenges to the Fairfield County corridor and now a project is starting. Wesaw the Yonkers Contracting banner and also wondered why there are noConnecticut Companies that win these bids. While most of the highway funds arefrom the Federal Government, it is still Connecticut taxpayer funds as CT hastraditionally received only 70 cents back on each federal dollar. As acandidate for Congress in Connecticut and campaigning on improving theFairfield County corridor, it is not just about improving the roads, buthaving a lasting impact on the local economies of Fairfield County andsurrounding counties that keep federally spent dollars in Connecticut.

We wouldappreciate your prompt attention to this matter as this is a major concern forour Voters. Traffic, Infrastructure, Climate Change and Health are on theBallot and the voter should be informed. Connecticut has also some of thehighest costs per mile for road repair and construction and our constituentsare concerned about inefficient use of taxpayer funds at the state and locallevel as poor spending hurts each resident in the pocketbook. We arethoroughly concerned about these issues. Sincerely, Dr. Michael T.

I didn't live in a skyrise apartment or a mansion with luxuries at myfingertips. I grew up in the Throggs Neck Houses, a crumbling public housingproject among vermin, lead, and mold, across from Trump's Golf Course in TheBronx. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc_torres_q42024_df?amount=3[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mc_torres_q42024_df?amount=3]My mom was asingle mom, working multiple jobs to keep food on the table. I'm so gratefulfor how much she sacrificed to provide for our family. Living across fromTrump's Golf Course, I had to see a reminder every day of how easily and oftenour government supports and enables the ultra-wealthy at the expense ofworking families. You see, the New York City government shoveled over $100million in government aid to develop this golf course with Donald Trump andthe corrupt Trump Organization. They did this while New York families likemine lived in hunger and poverty across the street. But, I always try to lookat the positives \u2014 growing up smelling the stench of Donald Trump (even beforehe became president) has led me to where I am today: Fighting in Congress forjustice for real working families. When I work on legislation, I always thinkabout the families who are struggling just like mine did. I lived thatexperience \u2014 it is not abstract to me. And I'll never forget it. I hope youfeel like you have a better sense of who I am and what my values are. I swearthat I'm fighting for those values every day in Congress. Right now, theshadow of Trump and his MAGA cult looms large. They're determined to strip ourright to vote, give tax breaks to people like Trump, and put special interestsahead of working families \u2013 and they\u2019re raising millions to pull it off.

Will you please give $5now to keep me on track to flip Florida blue?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2481-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 With just 72 hours until voters head to theballot box \u2014 amid reports that Rick Scott dumped another $10.5 MILLION tofurther blanket the airwaves with his own ads \u2014 this slowdown couldn't havecome at a worse time: * If grassroots donations stay on a downward trend, Iwon't have the funds to keep the ads we're airing on TV. * If I can't affordto keep my ads in front of Florida voters, my filthy-rich opponent will easilybuy up all the slots we'd be leaving on the table. * If Scott drowns out ourmessage with ads smearing me in this last leg of the race, there's no chancewe'll make a comeback in time for Election Day. That is, friend, unless I cancount on your help to stop the bleeding and meet my final $4 million goal. Inever would've entered striking distance of Rick Scott without your help, andI won't be able to overtake him in these final hours without you. Please,friend, will you rush $5, $25, or anything you can spare now to keep mecompetitive in the race to retire Rick and flip this Senate seat blue?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2481-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for everything, Debbie -------- Thisemail was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

But that\u2019s still within the margin of error. We\u2019re still beingoutspent. Ted Cruz barely hanging on. With less than 3 days to go, we MUSTslam the door shut on liberal schemes to flip Texas blue. If we don\u2019t, kissthe Senate goodbye for at least a generation.

I truly appreciate all you\u2019ve done to support my campaign.But I still need help-this race is still too close! Why is my race so close?Unfortunately, one reason is that my opponent Colin Allred is untruthful, andis attempting to hide his radical liberal views from Texas voters. It takes alot of time and money to set the record straight\u2026 For example, on the borderAllred now claims to love border security, and belatedly says he wants to finda solution to the Biden-Harris border crisis, but that\u2019s not how Allred votedin Congress\u2026 In Congress, Allred was an Open Borders Radical who voted AGAINSTthe interests of Texas and FOR open borders lawlessness numerous times: Allredvoted AGAINST the Secure the Border Act. Allred voted AGAINST denouncing theBiden Administration\u2019s immigration policies. Allred voted AGAINST condemningthe Biden border crisis and the tremendous burdens law enforcement officersface as a result. Allred voted AGAINST the POLICE Act, which would immediatelydeport any illegal alien who assaults a law enforcement officer. Allred votedAGAINST the SAVE Act, which was a bill that would block illegal aliens fromvoting in U.S. elections. And perhaps most shamefully, Allred SKIPPED a voteon the End the Border Catastrophe Act\u2026 It takes a lot of time and money to setthe record straight\u2026and of course the liberal media is working overtime tohelp Allred hide his record.

The election is daysaway, and right now we are falling short of our budget goal. After pouringover our polling, it became clear: If we had a bit more money, we could reachthe undecided voters we need to win this race. The money wasn\u2019t in the budget,but I gave the green light to ramp up our ad spending.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/katrina_email?amount=15] It\u2019s a risk. Butin a race this close and this important, it would be a mistake for us not toleave it all out on the field. I told my team that as the race tightens, oursupporters would step up to fill this budget gap to help us defeat extremeRepublican Kevin Cramer and keep the Senate out of Republicans\u2019 hands. So I\u2019mhumbly asking: Can I count on you to rush $15 before midnight to help fillthis budget gap and power my campaign in the final stretch?

I\u2019m worried you\u2019re sleeping on this, fellow American. Democrats have beenleading in the Generic Congressional Ballot for three months now, meaning moreAmericans would rather send a Democrat to represent them in Congress than aRepublican. We can take back the White House and the Senate, but if we losethe House \u2013 which we only hold by a handful of seats \u2013we can\u2019t get anythingdone. Our borders won\u2019t be secured, inflation won\u2019t go down, communities won\u2019tget safer, and government overreach won\u2019t be reeled in.

Fellow Patriot,I have an important message that I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be sending you today. Injust a moment, I am going to ask you to make a contribution to my campaign forU.S. Senate. November 5th isdays away, and I\u2019d really appreciate the chance toexplain why this request \u2014 especially today \u2014 is so critically important.Here\u2019s the truth: Right now, we have a week of media buys to pay for \u2014 themost important week of the entire campaign. And if we don\u2019t raise what we neednow, we will be forced to give up the airwaves and let Adam Schiff and theDemocrat-machine backing him up run their attacks on me unopposed. Whatmatters most right now is that we do whatever we can to fund a campaign thatcan win. That\u2019s the most important thing. Winning this race. Not just for thesake of winning, but because of what it would mean to substitute my presencewith Adam Schiff\u2019s in the Senate. That\u2019s a reality I don\u2019t think any of uswant to consider, but it\u2019s what will happen if we come up short. Now, time isrunning out. So, this is the part where I ask, one more time, and very humbly:Can you please use this link to make a donation to my campaign for U.S. Senatein California before Election Day?

Butit\u2019s also one of the most important, so it really would mean a lot to me ifyou could read through it. If you\u2019re in a hurry or if you\u2019re already sold andready to do whatever it takes to help me defeat Larry Hogan and defend ourSenate majority, [https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/33436?t=1010&amount;=25&akid;=3181%2E52803%2E7kOuRk]then please consider making a quick grassroots contribution to give us theresources and momentum to win this race in just 3 days! [https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/33436?t=1011&amount;=25&akid;=3181%2E52803%2E7kOuRk]Donate I want to outline our campaign's message to fill Maryland\u2019s open U.S.Senate seat. It hinges on 3 major components: Power to the People Thiscampaign has never been about me, Peter. It\u2019s always been about Marylanders,our families, and our communities. And when Republican Larry Hogan entered therace putting our Democratic Senate majority at risk, it became about thefuture of the entire country. That\u2019s why Republicans are pouring millions ofdollars into this race. But during the Democratic Primary, we proved thatMaryland is won by the many, not by the money. We\u2019ve never had limitlessresources, million dollar checks, or shady dark money super PACs pulling thestrings. Instead, we built a grassroots coalition of people in every corner ofthe state who stepped up to volunteer, donate, and talk to their neighborsabout our campaign. Your time and your contributions were the driving forcebehind our primary victory, and we need to continue building on that in orderto win on Tuesday. Focus on the Issues that Matter While Republicans arelining up to get behind Donald Trump and his divisive MAGA agenda, we'refocusing on the issues that matter most to people \u2014 like protecting abortionrights, improving wages, and preserving our democracy. My Republican opponentLarry Hogan hopes Marylanders won\u2019t remember that as governor, he vetoedlegislation that would have expanded access to abortion care throughout thestate. He\u2019s banking on Marylanders forgetting that he vetoed a $15 minimumwage and legislation to benefit unions and workers. He\u2019s hoping Marylanderswon\u2019t realize that electing him means handing control of the Senate over toextremists like Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham. On the issues that matter most,Hogan\u2019s record speaks for itself: He\u2019s all wrong for Maryland, and he\u2019ll sayand do whatever he thinks will win him this seat. Make the Case for aDemocratic Senate Majority Here\u2019s the truth, Peter: There simply isn\u2019t any wayDemocrats maintain our razor-thin Senate majority if Larry Hogan wins thisopen seat. Mitch McConnell handpicked Hogan for this race because he seesMaryland as his best chance to flip a seat, retake the majority, and enact hisfar-right, anti-choice agenda. If the GOP retakes the Senate, they'll have thepower to pass a national abortion ban, roll back environmental protections,undermine our elections, and so much more. Hogan has proven that he cannot betrusted to protect our reproductive rights or put Maryland families first.Defending the Senate is the only way to protect our freedoms, uplift workingfamilies, and preserve our democracy. We\u2019ve got a winning message that\u2019sresonating with voters, Peter, and I need your support to make sure everyonehears it.

Regardless of the outcome, it's clear that ourcountry is divided and in desperate need of new leaders who can unify everydaypeople across our shared priorities and against our shared enemies:corporations, billionaires, and right-wing extremists. Everyday people don'tsee any party fighting for their interests anymore. They see what we see:corporate Super PACs and billionaire donors dictating an agenda that rewardsthe wealthy few at the expense of everyone else. The outcomes of Tuesday'selection will drastically reshape the future of our nation and will demanddifferent urgencies from our movement. But no matter what, this moment callsfor building a new Democratic Party, led by new leaders that working familiesactually see fighting for their most pressing needs.

InsiderAdvantage \u2014 October 2024 Eric Hovde (R): 49% [+1] Tammy Baldwin (D): 48% Ever since Eric Hovde closed the polling gap in this race, Republicans see Wisconsin as one of their best opportunities to flip a Democrat-held Senate seat red. That\u2019s why Hovde, Mitch McConnell, and their right-wing allies have poured $100 million into Wisconsin to defeat Tammy. Tammy\u2019s opponent is surging at the worst possible time. Early and absentee voting is well underway. More than one million votes have already been cast, and we\u2019re running out of time to get our message in front of voters before polls close in just three days. Wisconsin elections always come down to the wire and this race is looking no different \u2014 which means every dollar matters in our final voter outreach efforts.

In Texas, thelaw provides prison for life, for healthcare providers, for doing what theybelieve is in the best interest of their patient. In some counties in Texas,they have passed travel bans to prevent women from going to other states toreceive care. These are the stakes \u2014 and we know how we got here. \u201d She\u2019sright \u2014 we do know how we got here: In 2021, Texas completely banned abortionwith very limited exceptions. Then, the Texas Supreme Court then ruled that awoman did not qualify for an abortion under the state\u2019s medical exceptiondespite the fact that her doctor determined she needed the procedure to saveher life. That decision forced a pregnant woman to travel out of state toreceive the care she needed to save her life. The justices doubled down onthat extreme decision this year, ruling against 20 women who said they weredenied the ability to receive medically necessary abortions as a result of thestate\u2019s extreme abortion ban. This is unconscionable, Peter \u2014 and we won\u2019t siton the sidelines while elected state supreme court justices rip away people\u2019srights. The NDRC is proud to have endorsed Judge DaSean Jones, Judge ChristineWeems, and Judge Bonnie Lee Goldstein for the Texas Supreme Court because oftheir commitment to be fair-minded, conduct an independent evaluation of thelaw, ensuring rights and protecting freedoms.

So many people have already voted that it\u2019s clear voting is nowmore a season than a single-day event. And while the way we vote might havechanged over the years, the importance of voting hasn't changed a bit. Do YouHave a Plan to Vote? Will You Bring a Friend Along to the Polls? Your votemight be the one that makes a difference in this election. With so much on theline in this election, we can\u2019t afford to sit it out. I hope you enjoy thesefun voting facts (Make Voting Fun Again!), but most importantly, I hope youMAKE A PLAN TO VOTE! Five Fun Facts about Voting & Elections Absentee Voting:Must Be More than Two Miles from Home Pennsylvania was the first state toallow absentee voting during the War of 1812, but you had to be at least twomiles from home! Bring Your Own Ballot (BYOB?) It wasn\u2019t until the election of1888 that ballots became standardized in the U.S. Before then, voters oftenbrought ballots passed out by political parties or wrote down their choices.Astronauts Can Vote from Space Thanks to a Texas law passed in 1997,astronauts can cast their votes from space. Using a secure ballot, NASAensures astronauts are never left out, even when orbiting the Earth. WhyTuesday? Why November? Tuesday was selected to avoid Sundays (for church) andWednesdays (market days for farmers). November was chosen because it was afterthe harvest season and before the harsh winter weather. Voting Wasn\u2019t AlwaysSecret Before the 1890s, there was nothing secret about voting. In fact, atthat time, many people believed voting should be a public act.

Most folks know me as a musician and coach on TheVoice, but I'm also a proud Ohioan. And I'm reaching out personally to ask youto join me in supporting Sherrod today. Most people don't know I grew up inSpringfield, Ohio. My mom was a seamstress and my dad was a factory worker,and I saw up close how hard they worked to support our family.

Senate control will be determined by Sherrod's race, so we must standtogether to protect reproductive rights, defend Social Security and Medicare,and save our democracy. This race is going to be tight. Polls show Sherrodnarrowly trailing his Trump-backed opponent, and political experts have calledSherrod one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection. Republicanswill do anything to defeat Sherrod, and they've outspent him 3-to-1 to attackhim relentlessly. That's why I had to reach out, friend. Sherrod needs ourgrassroots support right away: Will you chip in $5 or $25 to help Sherrod winin Ohio and keep the Senate blue?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?refcode=jtk3797-fr-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Ohio means a lot to me,and the working families there \u2013 and across America \u2013 deserve to have Sherrodin the U.S. Senate.

But thousands of Kansans had one less kitchen table bill to worryabout. When the bipartisan infrastructure law I fought for finally passed, myname didn\u2019t trend on Twitter.

And when we brought in millions of dollars tofund broadband expansion in rural communities, no, the New York Times didn\u2019tsend a camera crew to our office to cover it.

Here\u2019s THREE reasons whythis campaign is one of the most important House races in the country rightnow: 1\ufe0f\u20e3The DNC made a HISTORIC investment in Texas, shouting out our raceright here in TX-15, because they know we\u2019re against the ONLY vulnerable GOPHouse member in TX. 2\ufe0f\u20e3The House Majority PAC launched over $1.3 MILLION in TVads to help Michelle win, because they know our race is the PATH to aDemocratic majority. 3\ufe0f\u20e3The last poll showed our campaign only THREE pointsaway from our opponent, because WE know South Texans are sick and tired of herMAGA extremism.

He found a piece of grassy land, tooka look at it, and said, \u201cThis is the place.\u201d And that\u2019s where the farm began.He farmed the land until the early 1940s, and then passed it down to my folks.In 1978, my wife Sharla and I took over the farm and we\u2019re still here today,three generations and more than 40 years later. We\u2019ve made a lot of progresshere \u2014 Sharla and I built a new home, several steel buildings, and morestorage. The truth is, I love this work. Yes, it makes for early mornings andlate nights during planting and harvest seasons \u2014 but it also keeps megrounded, and it gives me perspective on the issues we face every day. When Ithink about climate change, I\u2019m thinking of folks on farms like mine,struggling with catastrophic droughts or historic levels of flooding. When Ithink about reforming the USPS, I\u2019m thinking of the people in ruralcommunities across Montana who rely on timely mail delivery for theirmedication or Social Security checks. And when I think about infrastructure,I\u2019m thinking of the rural towns near mine that need access to affordable,high-speed internet. These aren\u2019t abstract issues or talking points. They\u2019revery real challenges that deserve real solutions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m fightingfor in Washington. I spend every single day trying to do right by workingfamilies, farmers, students, and veterans here in Montana and across thecountry. I\u2019m running for reelection because there\u2019s still work to be done.Just like my parents and grandparents on the family farm, when I commit tosomething, I see it through. Can you make a split donation of any amount todaybetween my campaign and Voter Protection Project to help me keep up the fightin Washington?(https://act.protectvoting.org/go/83981?t=1003&akid;=17887%2E878179%2EtbMk5w)I\u2019ll leave you with one last truth about farming: Some years you get the rightamount of rain, and things work out really well. Other years, you get a wholelot less. That means it\u2019s important to be prepared for any outcome, and tohave a support system by your side when things get difficult. We don\u2019t knowwhat this campaign will look like, or what Republicans will throw our way overthese final few months. But with your support, we\u2019ll be ready. I appreciateanything you\u2019re able to pitch in. Thanks for your help, and I hope I make youproud. \u2014 Jon ------------------ Paid for by Voter Protection Projectwww.protectvoting.org Not authorized by any candidate or candidate'scommittee. 401 2nd Ave. S, Ste. 303, Seattle, WA 98104 Click here to requestfewer emails: https://act.protectvoting.org/signup/fewer-emails/?t=1001&akid;=17887%2E878179%2EtbMk5w Click here to unsubscribe:https://act.protectvoting.org/unsubscribe/unsubscribe/?akid=17887%2E878179%2EtbMk5w",

Connecting withFloridians is probably my favorite part of this race. But it doesn't comecheap. Ours is a big state, and with Election Day mere days away at thispoint, we're in overdrive mode in our efforts to reach communities acrossFlorida. Your grassroots donation makes that voter contact and mobilizationpossible. When everyone chips in a $25, $50, or $100 donation, it means moreyard signs for our supporters. It means we can boost our efforts to recruitvolunteers and canvassers and get them the tools they need. It means our adsacross TV, radio, and digital airwaves stay up and counter Rick Scott's liesand attacks. We have just 72 hours left to deploy resources into the field \u2014and with polls showing me locked in a dead heat with Rick Scott, every minutematters.

As we get closer to Election Day, I wanted to shine a light on Lisa Blunt Rochester, the Congresswoman from Delaware. Right now, she is in a heated race to become Delaware\u2019s next Senator. In a minute, I\u2019ll explain why you should chip in to support Lisa\u2019s historic campaign. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q42024] SUPPORT LISA \u2192 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q42024] Lisa\u2019s career as a public servant epitomizes the definition of what it means to be a leader and champion for everyone. Time and time again, she has helped create and pass meaningful legislation to build up our middle class, protect our seniors, and defend our voting and reproductive rights. In short, Lisa\u2019s mission of Bright Hope is one she hopes to bring to the Senate. But her self-funding opponent would rather spend nearly a million dollars to keep his campaign afloat and defend the overturning of Roe. I wish I was joking on that last point. The scary thing about all of this is that Delaware will be crucial to the Democrats\u2019 hopes of protecting their Senate majority. With a one-seat majority on the line, we need to do everything we can to lock this seat down and make Lisa the first Black and woman senator from Delaware. Folks \u2013 Election Day will be here before you know it. And in order to stop Trump, Vance, and Project 2025, we need to support Lisa Blunt Rochester by chipping in $10 or more to her campaign today.

Without even knowingthe outcome of the November election, MAGA Republicans are preemptively sowingdoubt about the results in case their candidate loses. And they\u2019re evencounting on election officials (like me and other Secretaries of State) tooverturn the results if they don\u2019t get their way. Let me be clear: we\u2019reelection administrators not politicians. I may be an elected official, but Ican separate my duty from my preference. I will always put the integrity ofour elections and the will of the people above partisan interests. With justdays until Election Day, we\u2019re already seeing a surge in threats against ourelection officials. And the truth is, they\u2019re only intensifying as extremistscontinue to spread misinformation and stoke fear. My friends at the DemocraticAssociation of Secretaries of State are monitoring these threats and aregearing up for up for attacks on election results, but they need support fromgrassroots Democrats like you.

I really want you to see the whole thing. Please check this out! WATCH PRES. TRUMP\u2019S NM REMARKS \u00bb \u2014Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

And I can tell you firsthand that the polls and thepundits are right: our women's races will be close. There's a saying inpolitics, beloved by fundraisers and field organizers alike: the margin ofeffort. When the polls are tight, and a race could go either way, what mattersmost is the heart, grit, and commitment of the supporters. If we put in thework, we'll win. If we don't, we won't. It's that simple. Critical races likeVP Kamala Harris', Sen. Tammy Baldwin's (WI-SEN), and Rep. Susan Wild's(PA-07) now fall squarely within the margin of effort. And your support canhelp make sure we reach as many voters as possible before Nov. 5. Let's giveit all we've got, Peter.

I\u2019ve really enjoyed hitting the campaign trail and meeting with voters who are fired up and ready to win this race. We\u2019re one step closer to flipping OR-05 and taking back the House. But here's the bad news : We\u2019re up against millions of dollars in spending by deep-pocketed Republicans. My opponent, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, is backed by Republican special interest groups who are willing to spend whatever it takes to hold this seat. As they put more money into this race, we need a flood of support to fight back and make sure we\u2019re not getting drowned out on the airwaves. That's why I'm personally asking: Will you split a donation between Tina Kotek and me today to help us keep our ads on the air and continue to reach undecided voters? With everything we\u2019re up against, we can\u2019t afford to fall short. Not when this race could decide control of the House. \u2192 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?] If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your split donation to Janelle Bynum and Tina Kotek will go through immediately: CHIP IN $10 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?express_lane=true&amount;=10] CHIP IN $25 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?express_lane=true&amount;=25] CHIP IN $50 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?express_lane=true&amount;=50] CHIP IN $100 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?express_lane=true&amount;=100] CHIP IN $250 NOW [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum?express_lane=true&amount;=250] ANOTHER AMOUNT [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tk-em-bynum] Thank you, Janelle Tina for Oregon PO Box 42307 Portland, OR 97242 tinafororegon.com [https://www.tinafororegon.com/] | info@tinafororegon.com [info@tinafororegon.com] Paid for by Friends of Tina Kotek This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com .

Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours.

We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day.

But I thought alittle reminder would be helpful, especially contrasted with who Rick Scott is\ud83e\udd2e.Maybe it will even motivate you to make a donation before tonight'sfundraising deadline to ensure I can defeat Rick Scott! First and foremost,I'm everything I am today because of my mother. She brought my sisters and meto America when I was just 14. Mom knew we had to get out of Ecuador, whichwas transitioning to democracy after suffering under a military dictatorship.She knew America was the key to a better life. Well, with a whole lot of hardwork (including working in a doughnut shop to help my family get by), longhours, and a ton of hope, we were able to win our American dream. My story iswhat inspires me to give back to this incredible country and state that gaveme so much. After putting myself through college, I worked for severalnonprofit organizations across Florida, helping toprotect our wildlife andpreserve our coral reefs. Rick Scott, on the other hand, banned saying thewords \"climate change\" when he was governor of Florida, and the League ofConservation Voters gave him a whopping 0% score last year. During my timeworking at Florida International University, I spearheaded a new programtoexpand affordable health care access to more Floridians. But Rick Scott hasvoted to repeal the Affordable Care Act more times than I care to count. Andwho can forget he committed one of the largest Medicare frauds in the historyof our country. Eventually, I had the honor of serving my community in theU.S. House of Representatives, where I became the first South Americanimmigrant to be elected to Congress! In the House, I wrote the bill toexpandseniors\u2019 Medicare Advantage coverage, worked with Republicans to provideeconomic relief to families and small businesses, andsecured $200 million forEverglades restoration. I'm proud of my record \u2014 but can Rick Scott say thesame, friend? He has used his time in office writing the plan to end SocialSecurity and Medicare, attempting to undermine our elections, attacking ourrights, and making it harder for working families to get ahead. As a result,Rick Scott's approval ratings with Floridians are underwater. Even a largepercentage of Republicans don't approve of him! Now, polling shows mestatistically tied with Scott, and in just 8 days, we can defeat him andprotect our Democratic Senate majority in the process. But with Rick Scottoutspending me 3-1 on the airwaves, it's going to take a surge in grassrootssupport from people like you to truly defeat him. So please, rush a donationof $5 or whatever you can to send me to the U.S. Senate and give Floridiansthe true leader and public servant we deserve!

That\u2019s why I\u2019m personally asking if youwill donate directly to 6 Democrats running in 6 toss-up Red-to-Blue Houseraces ahead of their deadlines tonight. If Christina Bohannan (IA-1), Dr.Amish Shah (AZ-1), Janelle Bynum (OR-5), George Whitesides (CA-27), JohnMannion (NY-22), and Tony Vargas (NE-2) win we have the numbers to flip theHouse blue. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kl-email-241018-314?refcode=KL_ATA_EM_FR_314_241025_T1_2_b Christina Bohannan (IA-1) \u2013 Christina is anenvironmental engineer and law professor who defeated a 20-year incumbent tosecure a seat in the Iowa State Legislature. In 2020, Republicans flipped thisseat from blue to red by the slimmest margin of any House race in nearly anentire century \u2013 a margin of just 6 votes (0.01% of the vote). And pollingconfirms it could be just as competitive this November. Normington, Petts &Associates Poll: Bohannan 47% \u2013 Miller-Meeks 47% Dr. Amish Shah (AZ-1) \u2013 Amishis an Emergency Room physician at the Mayo Clinic of Arizona and StateRepresentative who had the most bills signed into law of any Arizona Democratof the past decade. In 2022, Republicans barely defended this seat by a marginof just 3,195 votes (which was less than 1% of the vote). It could be evencloser this time around. In 2020, Joe Biden won this district by 1.5%. ImpactResearch Poll: Shah 48% \u2013 Schweikert 48% Janelle Bynum (OR-5) \u2013 Janelle is anelectrical engineer, small business owner, and former State Representative whohas defeated Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer (who she is now running against)not once but twice at the state level. In 2022, Republicans flipped this seatfrom blue to red by a razor-thin margin of just 2.1% of the vote. In 2020, JoeBiden won this district by 8.8% of the vote \u2013 one of the largest margins ofany House seat actively held by a Republican. Noble Predictive Insights Poll:Bynum 43% \u2013 Chavez-DeRemer 42% George Whitesides (CA-27) \u2013 George is anaerospace expert who served as the Chief of Staff for NASA under PresidentBarack Obama, served as CEO of the spaceflight company Virgin Galactic, andco-founded a group to address wildfire disasters. In 2020, Republicans flippedthis seat from blue to red by a razor-thin margin \u2013 just 333 votes (a marginof 0.1% of the vote). In 2020, Joe Biden won this district by a massive marginof 12.4% of the vote \u2013 more than almost any other House district currentlyrepresented by a Republican. University of Southern California Poll:Whitesides 48% \u2013 Garcia 46% John Mannion (NY-22) \u2013 John is a former scienceteacher who won a highly competitive State Senate seat on Republican turf byjust 10 votes to win a seat in the New York State Legislature. In 2022,Republicans barely defended this House seat by a razor-thin margin of just2,631 votes (which is less than 1% of the vote!). In 2020, Joe Biden won thisdistrict by a margin of 7.4% of the vote \u2013 which is part of the reason theNational Journal labeled this as the best red-to-blue pickup opportunity inthe United States! Tony Vargas (NE-2) \u2013 Tony is a former science teacher andschool board member who currently serves in the Nebraska State Senate. In2022, Tony fell just 5,856 votes (a margin of just 2.6% of the vote) offlipping this seat from red to blue. In 2020, Joe Biden won this district by amargin of 6.4% of the vote and it's only grown more Democratic since.

If we step up, we inspire other nations toact, too. But if we fail, it becomes harder for any country to hit the targetsneeded to keep our planet livable.

While I usually wouldn't go into this much detail, I also wouldn't have made it this far without you, so it's only right that you should have full disclosure. But you also need to know that our midnight fundraising deadline is coming up, and I can't afford to fall short on my FINAL $4 million goal \u2014 so before we dig in, can I count on you to rush $10 now to split between me and Kirsten Gillibrand and keep me on track to reach my midnight goal and flip Florida blue? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5620-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Date: Nov. 2, 2024 Subject: [INTERNAL MEMO] The Case for Florida's Senate Race At this stage of the 2024 election, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell's race in Florida is now the Democrats' BEST SENATE PICKUP OPPORTUNITY nationwide: * Columnists at The Washington Post report that Rick Scott has failed to write as many of the \u201cmassive personal checks that he used to win the governor\u2019s mansion.\" * Despite previously self-funding his races at historic levels, Rick Scott has never won an election in Florida by more than 1%. * Debbie's run a highly efficient ad campaign fueled by small-dollar donations, allowing her to reach 76% of voters across Florida's four top media markets. * Recent polls by a GOP-allied firm shows Scott's popularity is tanking by 11 points, and the race is in a DEAD HEAT at Scott 50 - Mucarsel-Powell 48. * Another advantage is the popular ballot initiative for restoring abortion rights, which is expected to help drive turnout similar to that of the 2020 election. * With a personal story that easily counters Scott's \"socialism\" attacks, and regular appearances on Spanish-language media, Debbie can rally Latino voters \u2014 nearly 1 in every 4 voters in Florida \u2014 unlike any other Senate candidate this cycle. The only thing left that Debbie needs to win is a sizable grassroots cash infusion over these final few days before the election. With it, she can help retain the Senate for Democrats, and bring new leadership to the Sunshine State. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5620-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 # # # So friend, now that you know where we stand in the race, there's just one thing left for me to ask you: Will you please chip in $10, $25, or any amount you can spare now to split between Kirsten Gillibrand and me and help to reach my very last $4 million goal on time, retire Rick Scott, and flip Florida's Senate seat blue? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5620-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for all you do.

That\u2019s the amount I am humbly asking you to give to my campaign to help me defeat Lauren Boebert. Yep, just $5. $5 because last year, Adam Frisch lost to Lauren Boebert by just 546 votes. $5 because now Lauren Boebert has moved to my district, and I am the Democratic nominee running against her. $5 because the polling shows Boebert is still incredibly vulnerable and in danger of losing! And $5 because if we turn this seat blue, Democrats are almost guaranteed to take back the House \u2013 and that\u2019s why Lauren Boebert and Speaker Johnson\u2019s Super PACs are attacking me. I know $5 might not seem like much \u2013 and to be honest, it\u2019s not. But over 75,000 grassroots donors like you have already chipped in to my campaign, and we are building a grassroots movement to defeat Lauren Boebert \u2013 $5 at a time. We cannot stop or let up now. Not when we are so close to giving Boebert the boot. My campaign has set a goal to raise another $30,000 to fight back and defeat Lauren Boebert, but we are still extremely far away with time running out before our critical fundraising deadline. **Please, can I count on you to make a donation to my campaign right now \u2013 no amount is too small \u2013 to help me defeat Lauren Boebert, flip this seat blue, and take back the House for Democrats?** _Please use the links in this email to start a weekly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  I have been so humbled by the massive outpouring of support my campaign hasgotten from people like you all across the country.But I\u2019m not taking money from corporate PACs, so I need your continued supportnow if we\u2019re going to win and finally defeat Lauren Boebert.Thank you \u2013 from the bottom of my heart,Trisha  ********Paid for by Trisha 4 ColoradoTrisha 4 Colorado PO Box 630633 Highlands Ranch, CO 80130Contributions or gifts to Trisha 4 Colorado are not tax deductible.This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

Kari Lake has more resources at her disposal than we do, and we arefalling behind. The way we retake the momentum is you. If everyone readingthis donated just $5, we would not only fully fund our advertising in thisfinal week. We would not only receive a historic number of donations. We wouldturn this election upside down. We\u2019d raise enough to defeat Kari Lake. UnlikeKari, Ruben can\u2019t depend on a handful of billionaires to bail this campaignout. We\u2019re sustained by the donations of less than 5% of Ruben\u2019s supporters.Without those donations, big or small, we wouldn\u2019t have a chance. That\u2019s whywe need your help. We\u2019re passionate about the way we fundraise becauseultimately this campaign is powered by you.

Let me explain why: As you read this, Trump and his right-wing allies are outspending us on ads attacking my character and values. They are running them in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. _States that we need to win._ I do not lose sleep over what an unhinged and unstable man thinks about me. What _does_ keep me up at night, is what is at stake in this election and the thought of undecided voters seeing his hate-fueled message before we have a chance to correct the record. **We can and must reach these voters -- and that takes significant resources.** Peter, it looks like you are still waiting for the best moment to donate to our campaign. Will you make today the day you chip in your first $47 or $75? Representing Pennsylvania with a contribution is one of the most meaningful actions you can take in the final days of this election. _If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:_ | | $47 >> --- | $75 >> --- | $100 >> --- | $250 >> --- | $500 >> --- | Other >> ---  Donald Trump is counting on us to lose momentum.I refuse to give him that satisfaction. And from what I know about thisgrassroots team, you will not either.We are still the underdogs in this race. We are going to win, and it is goingto take grassroots supporters like you joining our fight with a donation tomake it happen.That is why I lean on you a bit more on days like today, Peter.Please use this link to chip in $47 ahead of our campaign\u2019s midnightfundraising deadline. Your $47 donation right now -- not tomorrow, not the dayafter, but today -- will directly fund our work to reach and win overpersuadable voters in these final three days.This is the most consequential election of our lifetime. It would mean theworld to me to see your name on our list of donors for the first time.KamalaKamala Harris Vice President of the United States          * * *| | DONATE --- | TAKE ACTION --- | SHOP ---  * * *This email was sent to **dpwillis67@gmail.com**.
