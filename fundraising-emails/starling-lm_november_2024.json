First of all, there just sohappen to be 3 judges of the Oklahoma Supreme Court on the ballot. And theyare ALL liberal. They are all THREE appointed by Democrat Governors. And wehave the chance to remove all three at once. If WE vote NO on all threeliberal Supreme Court judges, they will be removed and can no longer be ableto force their liberal agenda on Oklahoma. The question on your ballot will beif Edmonson, Gurich, & Kauger should be retained in their current positions.And the answer is NO, they should not be retained. All three must go, so wemust all VOTE NO! Secondly, you\u2019ll be voting on several candidates beyond justthe President. We can all compare the economic boom with 4 years of PresidentTrump to the disastrous 4 years under Biden-Harris. If your mind isn\u2019t alreadymade up on who to vote for as President think of how much better off you were4 years ago & realize we can have that again. There are other candidates onthe ballot, so the easiest way to vote is to choose \u201cRepublican\u201d straightparty voting. That\u2019ll make your selection for all those races & help put inRepublicans at the State & local level to help restore our economy & keep moremoney in your pockets. And third, you\u2019ll also have two State Questions on yourballot. SQ833 creates new tax structures. Many people are torn on how to votefor this, but we\u2019ll just put out there that we don\u2019t believe the governmentneeds MORE ways to tax us. If you agree we don\u2019t need more tax options, you\u2019llvote no on this one. As for SQ834 it would clarify that ONLY citizens can votein Oklahoma elections. It\u2019s obvious part of the Biden-Harris open border planis to get more people voting, including non-citizens. In fact a dozen citiesalready allow non-citizens to vote INCLUDING Washington DC! We must secure ourelections by allowing ONLY citizens to vote. Otherwise liberal court judges(refer to the first item listed above!) will allow law-breaking foreigners tovote in our elections. So there you have it, the three things you needtoknow. 1) Vote no on all THREE Supreme Court judges. 2) Vote Republicanstraight party. 3) On the State Questions vote for lower taxes & ONLY citizensvoting. -Team OKGOP -=-=- Paid for by OKGOP and not authorized by anycandidate or candidate's committee. www.OKGOP.com - (405) 528-3501. 4031 N.Linconln Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK 73105 This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.

Whenever Trump gets near a microphone, it\u2019s almost a given that he\u2019s going to attack me. At a MAGA rally in California, Trump threatened to withhold federal assistance for wildfires, attacked me personally, and urged his supporters to back GOP candidates across California.

He even threatened to use the military against me for holding him accountable. His goal is simple, Derek: sabotage my campaign and silence anyone standing in his way. It\u2019s clear Trump and his allies still see me as a threat \u2014 and the closer we get to Election Day, the worse and more frequent the attacks will become.

But first, I want to update you on everything that\u2019s been happening. We\u2019re only 5 days away from the election, and attacks from MAGA Republicans are non-stop \u2014 especially Donald Trump. Whenever Trump gets near a microphone, it\u2019s almost a given that he\u2019s going to attack me. At a MAGA rally in California, Trump threatened to withhold federal assistance for wildfires, attacked me personally, and urged his supporters to back GOP candidates across California. On Fox News, Trump rolled out a dangerous new attack, calling me the \u201cenemy within,\u201d claiming that I\u2019m even more dangerous than foreign adversaries. He even threatened to use the military against me for holding him accountable. His goal is simple, Derek: sabotage my campaign and silence anyone standing in his way. It\u2019s clear Trump and his allies still see me as a threat \u2014 and the closer we get to Election Day, the worse and more frequent the attacks will become. I don\u2019t take a dime from corporate PACs, so it will take a movement of grassroots supporters to overcome Trump and his allies\u2019 attacks.

        "clean_body": "At West Point, we had a code: cadets don't lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do. First the New York Times lied about my childhood and family, and now CNN is lying about my business record. And what\u2019s worse, they are doing it all because I\u2019m within striking distance of an entrenched career politician, Bob Casey, in the #1 swing state in the nation that will determine control of the U.S Senate. Bob Casey is getting Leftist news sources to do his dirty work, and I WON\u2019T TOLERATE IT. Here's the truth: this is a long message and I hope you will read all the way to the end. I grew up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. We lived on campus at Bloomsburg State College and my parents owned a farm ten minutes down the road. I had summer jobs baling hay and trimming Christmas trees at nearby farms. My dad started his career teaching history, economics, & democracy at Punxsutawney High. My mom began teaching fourth through sixth graders at a public school near Pittsburgh. I\u2019m incredibly proud that my dad was chosen to be president of Bloomsburg State College (now Bloomsburg University) at only 34 years old. I\u2019m so proud of my parents\u2019 teaching careers and to have been raised in Bloomsburg. It was there that I wrestled and played football and was nominated to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. And it was there that I came home to a parade after serving in combat during the Gulf War. After the Army, I earned a Ph.D. in international relations before moving to Pittsburgh to start a career in business. I worked my way up to become the CEO of FreeMarkets, a successful tech startup that employed hundreds in Western Pennsylvania. I was then called to service again, this time in the highest levels of government as Under Secretary of Treasury and as Deputy National Security Advisor. Following this, I joined Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest, most successful investment firms in the world, which manages the pension plans of groups including teachers, firefighters and law enforcement. I have lived the American Dream, and I am running for Senate to bring my decades of experience and love for our country to fix our broken economy that is a direct result of policies supported by my opponent, who has spent 18 years in Washington with NOTHING to show for it. I knew getting into this race could mean things would get nasty, but it\u2019s sad to see we\u2019ve fallen so far that these media outlets like the New York Times and CNN are pushing the Democrats\u2019 baked narrative about my upbringing and my business record. I\u2019ve opened myself and my family up to attacks from the left, and every day feels like a battle. But I\u2019m no stranger to fighting for what is right and if we don\u2019t elect leaders to go to DC to clean up the mess the career politicians made, we will lose America as we know it! Here\u2019s where I need your help, Fellow Patriot. We need to combat these lies with the TRUTH about me. The Democrats are seeing the same polls you and I see. They know if Kamala Harris and Bob Casey lose Pennsylvania, they lose it ALL, and they are going to do WHATEVER IT TAKES to try and defeat me. I hate asking for money \u2014 I\u2019m not a career politician, and it\u2019s not in my nature \u2014 but I have no choice but to ask if we\u2019re going to hit our fundraising goal for the final stretch of the campaign. Will you chip in $30 or more right now to fight back against the lies from the Left? Chuck Schumer and his allies are working overtime to obliterate my campaign. They have committed to spend whatever it takes to defeat me.They know if I win this race in Pennsylvania, it\u2019ll be IMPOSSIBLE for Democrats to keep their majority in the Senate. If we don\u2019t show the Democrats we can win this race, it\u2019s game over. That\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping you can spare $29, $50, or even $100 to help me fight back against the lies.

I need you to keep fighting every single day, every single moment, until the polls close on Tuesday. Our campaign is working 24/7 to reach remaining undecided voters and get out the vote.

Your $5 or $10 contribution, in addition to your vote, is needed to help us secure more votes. Please chip in anything you can, and let\u2019s win this thing! Let's Flip New Mexico RED! Thank you, Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

RUSH MY DONATION Last time around, Ted Cruz won his race by just over 2% of the vote \u2013 that was a difference of about 215,000 votes, Peter. I remember how it felt watching the results roll in on November 6, 2018, and let me tell you, it was a nail-biter. I have no doubts that this year will be when we finally send Ted Cruz packing. But despite being closer than ever to defeating Ted, we've still got a lot more work to do and only a handful of days left to do it. I know seeing a number like $3 million can feel overwhelming, but if thousands of hardworking folks like you chip in $5 here, $25 there, and the occasional $100, we will be able to collectively reach this critical goal.

Let me explain: Over the past month, I've been on the ground in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, and a few other key states. I've talked to voters, candidates, and volunteers all across the country. And I can tell you firsthand that the polls and the pundits are right: our women's races will be close. There's a saying in politics, beloved by fundraisers and field organizers alike: the margin of effort. When the polls are tight, and a race could go either way, what matters most is the heart, grit, and commitment of the supporters. If we put in the work, we'll win. If we don't, we won't. Critical races like VP Kamala Harris', Sen. Tammy Baldwin's (WI-SEN), and Rep. Susan Wild's (PA-07) now fall squarely within the margin of effort.

Now that she's catching up to him in the polls, people are starting tonotice that with Debbie as the Democratic nominee, Florida is winnable. As asitting senator from Georgia, I'll always put working families and smallbusinesses first, friend. And like me, Debbie knows that we need to do more tosupport hardworking Americans in the South and across the country. With hercommitment to reducing high costs and inflation, protecting Social Securityand Medicare, and restoring reproductive freedom, we need Debbie's voice inthe Senate representing Floridians. But I know the GOP machine is about to goall in on Florida. We need to build on the growing Democratic excitement andhelp Debbie reach her $10 million goal before her last end-of-month deadlinebefore the election. That way, she can pull ahead in the polls and win big inNovember. Friend, will you chip in $5 or more right now to help Debbie win anddefend our Democratic Senate majority?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2477-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for offering your support to Debbie'scampaign today.

Six days from rightnow, voters will decide the future of America. I'm looking at the early votetotals and I'll be completely upfront with you\u2026 I'm beyond worried. I'mpetrified. The Democrat voter turnout/ballot harvesting machine is chargingfull speed ahead to rob Donald Trump of the presidency, steal the House, andhold the line in the Senate. At this point, we could wake up on November 6thto a full Democrat takeover of America. That's why President Trump and I areworking hand in glove to save the country.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bI'm campaigning on stage with him. I'm traveling to swing states like Michiganto turn out voters. And I'm rallying Republican voters in Tennessee and beyondto win. The only problem is I'm about $80,000 short of my fundraising goalright now. I'm scared that if I don't make up the lost ground, I'll have toshut down our voter turnout operation for the final stretch of the election. Ididn't want to burden you with this but I'm out of options. I'm forced to cometo you - with my hat in hand - to plead with you for help. If you can spareeven a few dollars, it would mean a great deal to me.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bCONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT If you canhttps://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bpitch in $100 - $250, it would make a huge dent in my budget shortfall andchange everything.

If every Conservative gave at leastthis much, the Democrats would be out of power for a generation. All I ask isthat you donate something before Election Day. I'm afraid that if too manyfolks sit on the sidelines - and decide not to give - the Democrats will walkaway with this election. Do not let this happen.

Thank you, Nella Domenici Help Elect Nella and Secure the Border \u00bb ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici's home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella's family's roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5%, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world's largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

You're the unsung hero of our party, and I'm honored to stand alongside you in this fight. Now, as we sprint to the finish line, I need your help one more time if you can spare a few dollars. We're facing a fierce battle in the final days of this election, and every dollar counts. That's why I'm humbly asking you to make a final contribution to help defend our razor-thin House Majority. Your donation will go directly towards our Get Out the Vote efforts, advertising, and other key pieces of our campaign operation. It will help us defend our vulnerable incumbents, flip key seats, and elect a new generation of conservative leaders. If you can swing it, one last contribution would mean the world to me, but if not, please don't stress, you've done so much for us already.

UnlikeRick Scott, I don\u2019t have a massive fortune at my campaign\u2019s disposal. I comefrom a working-class family, so I know my eye-watering $4 million goal isnothing to shake a stick at. But it's the only way I\u2019ll be able to defeat him.If that\u2019s all you need to hear, please click here to chip in $10 now \u2014 but I\u2019dlike to share what your hard-earned $10 means to me. See, my family moved to theUnited States from Ecuador when I was 14. But it didn\u2019t come easy, and despite my momworking back-to-back double shifts, we still struggled to afford rent on ourone room apartment. So once I turned 15, I began taking early morning shiftsat a doughnut shop before school. It wasn\u2019t much, but the extra cash gave myfamily room to breathe, and eventually, the life we dreamt of finally cametrue. But I\u2019m not the only one who got their start in the doughnut business.When he was a young man, my opponent, Rick Scott, bought two doughnut shops.While I made minimum wage to help keep the lights on at home, he reaped thebenefits of his employees' hard work. For me, those $10 boxes of doughnutswere a lifeline that helped my family get by. For him, they kicked off acareer in penthouse C-suites. And with your $10, you can help me kick Rick outof the Senate on election night \u2014 so please, pitch in now. I went on to graduate college, fight to improve life for working familieslike my own, and become the first South American immigrant elected toCongress. Rick Scott went on to enrich himself off U.S. taxpayers via thelargest Medicare fraud scheme in history, amass a nine-figure fortune, and buyhis way into the Senate. So I don\u2019t take your help toward reaching my $4million goal lightly. There\u2019s simply no way I could ever do it on my own. Myopponent, however, can spend $4 million to get his ads on screens withoutthinking twice \u2014 and he has already spent plenty more to stop me. So the onlyway we\u2019ll get him out and give working Floridians the Senate representationwedeserve is if we hit my $4 million goal. Please, friend: Will you give just$10 \u2014 about the cost of a dozen doughnuts \u2014 to help me retire Rick Scott? This campaign is powered by small-dollar donations, so every cent makes abig difference. Thank you for everything, Debbie",

Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day. So our kids grow up in democracy, not dystopia. Thank you for your support for all we do!

View it in your web browser --- | | |  --- | | | About BlueAmp Action: We cannot sugarcoat the current situation. Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day. So our kids grow up in democracy, not dystopia. Thank you for your support for all we do!

The only way Trisha can fight back and finally put an end to Boebert\u2019s embarrassing political \u201ccareer\u201d is with support from grassroots donors like you now. In 2022, Lauren Boebert only won by 546 votes. It was the closest race in the entire country.

But Trisha\u2019s not taking a dime from corporate PACs, so we\u2019ve got nowhere else to turn:** **Please, will you make a donation now \u2013 every single dollar you can afford \u2013 to help Trisha Calvarese defeat Lauren Boebert, turn this seat blue, and take back the House for Democrats?** _Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  We\u2019re so grateful that you\u2019re a part of this campaign.Thank you,Team Trisha  ********Paid for by Trisha 4 ColoradoTrisha 4 Colorado PO Box 630633 Highlands Ranch, CO 80130Contributions or gifts to Trisha 4 Colorado are not tax deductible.This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

The only way Trisha can fight back and finally put an end to Boebert\u2019s embarrassing political \u201ccareer\u201d is with support from grassroots donors like you now. In 2022, Lauren Boebert only won by 546 votes. It was the closest race in the entire country. So we need grassroots donors like you to give every dollar you can spare now if Democratic nominee Trisha Calvarese is going to beat Boebert and take back the House for Democrats. **This seat could be the difference between taking back the House or letting Republicans stay in control. But Trisha\u2019s not taking a dime from corporate PACs, so we\u2019ve got nowhere else to turn:** **Please, will you make a donation now \u2013 every single dollar you can afford \u2013 to help Trisha Calvarese defeat Lauren Boebert, turn this seat blue, and take back the House for Democrats?** _Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  We\u2019re so grateful that you\u2019re a part of this campaign.Thank you,Team Trisha  ********Paid for by Trisha 4 ColoradoTrisha 4 Colorado PO Box 630633 Highlands Ranch, CO 80130Contributions or gifts to Trisha 4 Colorado are not tax deductible.This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

Right now, Kamala and Trump are locked in a neck-and-neck race to the finish line, Democrats are at risk of losing the Senate, and so much is on the line on Election Night. Can we count on you to chip in $15 or more to Blue Amp Action today so we can invest in getting Kamala and other key Democratic candidates elected? Your support will allow us to send money where it\u2019s needed most, combat misinformation, and show Trump once and for all that the American people REJECT him and his extremist views. Your support will give Democrats the momentum they need to pull ahead in this critical moment and WIN. Please, Peter, can you chip in any amount to Blue Amp Action today?

View it in your web browser --- | | |  --- | | | About BlueAmp Action: We cannot sugarcoat the current situation. Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day. So our kids grow up in democracy, not dystopia. Thank you for your support for all we do!

        "clean_body": "The day before the Supreme Court\u2019s disastrous Dobbs decision, I woke up to Fox News and Lauren Boebert attacking my sister and my 81-year-old father. For decades, Dad was an OB-GYN. He delivered thousands of babies and wrote books on how to get pregnant and to navigate menopause. Dad provided women with full access to all kinds of reproductive health care, including abortions, in the years right after Roe \u2013 and he has now had to watch as women\u2019s reproductive rights are gutted in the aftermath of Dobbs . Dad and his clinic faced many threats over the years. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that he put his own safety \u2013 and that of his family \u2013 at risk in order to protect the rights of women to make their own medical decisions. But I\u2019m not sure he ever expected to see a sitting member of Congress attacking him \u2013 or my sister \u2013 in a national news outlet. It\u2019s disgusting. These kinds of personal attacks against my family have no place in our politics and do nothing to serve the people of Western and Southern Colorado. If extremists like Lauren Boebert and my new Republican opponent want to have a conversation about reproductive rights in this country, I am more than happy to have that debate. We can talk about how I support freedom and liberty \u2013 and how they support big government intruding into the lives of women. We can talk about how they support a national ban on abortion \u2013 with no exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the mother. And we can talk about how they are so extreme, they even want to ban the pill that\u2019s been used by women for decades. I am willing to talk allday about the fringe view that the government should be dictating women\u2019s medical decisions. But what I won\u2019t accept is extremists like Lauren Boebert and Fox News attacking my father and my sister. I am incredibly proud of my father. He provided health care to women when they needed it during some of the happiest \u2013 and most devastating \u2013 moments of their lives. Beforeretirement, he would drive two hours to Planned Parenthood and help teach the next generation of health care providers, like my sister. And no one \u2013 not Fox News, and especially not extremists like Lauren Boebert or my new Republican opponent \u2013 is going to stop my family from continuing to stand up for a woman\u2019s right to choose. We already scared off Lauren Boebert. In 2022, I came just 546 votes shy of winning this House seat. I\u2019m ready to finish the job and replace Boebert in Congress, but these are the kinds of ugly attacks that I\u2019m up against. Please, if you can afford to, will you give $5 or more right now to my campaign to help me win this critical House seat? Our race was the closest in the entire country in 2022.

From the White House to down-ballot races,polls show that Democrats are in a dead heat to win the presidency and bothCongressional chambers. 4. 5. If Democrats win across the board, Kamala Harrisand Tim Walz will be able to effectively govern and bring all Americans onanew path forward. 6. 7.

Virginia isn\u2019t just our surprise swing state this year. The roads to majorities in Congress could very well run right through Virginia. That\u2019s why I\u2019m mobilizing resources online and on the road to reach voters and turn Virginia red in these final days. To support these efforts, we\u2019re running an urgent end-of-month fundraising surge to power us through Election Day.

Please, pitch in anything you can. Thank you, Jason Miyares Virginia Attorney General WHO IS JASON MIYARES AND WHY IS HE WRITING TO ME? Jason Miyares is the Attorney General of Virginia \u2014 but his story doesn\u2019t start in Virginia\u2026 It starts in Havana, Cuba, when his mother, Miriam Miyares, fled communist Cuba pennyless and homeless. She immigrated to Virginia and raised Jason to appreciate freedom, fairness, and justice for all. In 2015, almost fifty years to the day that she fled Cuba, Miriam was able to vote for Jason to represent her in the Virginia House of Delegates. After working as a prosecutor and serving for three terms in the state legislature, he ran and was elected the 48th Attorney General of Virginia. Since his inauguration in January 2022, Jason has been focused on fighting violent crime and improving public safety, strengthening economic growth, combatting the deadly impact of opioids and fentanyl, and protecting Virginians from corporate misconduct. He\u2019s been fearless in standing up for the rule of law by challenging the Biden-Harris Administration whenever it tries to use lawfare to advance its radical agenda, whether it\u2019s failing to secure the border or advancing its extreme green agenda. This year, he\u2019s not on the ballot \u2014 but the American Miracle is. Jason Miyares is laser-focused on making sure that we win Virginia this year, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s writing to you today. Will you join Jason\u2019s team and help him turn Virginia red?

We\u2019re 3 days from Election Day, so here\u2019s 3reasons why we need you to chip in $3 today to help us win NY-16: 1. NY-16needs a Congressman who will bring about actionable changes to improve thelives of those in New York\u2019s 16th, and support Kamala Harris & Tim Walz\u2019sagenda. 2. 3. George has dedicated over THREE DECADES of his life to servingthe people of New York State by focusing on real results, not rhetoric. 4. 5.The only way we\u2019re going to be able to stay competitive is with a groundswellof local grassroots support. We can elect people who gain through division, orwe can elect people who are willing to get to work and help the people in ourcommunity who need it most.

She's a former senior advisor for the United Nations and Vice Mayor of Phoenix. She has broken barriers her entire life, including becoming the first Iranian-American woman elected to public office in Arizona. Now, as the Democratic nominee for AZ-03, she's on the cusp of becoming the youngest woman in Congress and the first Iranian-American Democrat. And here's the thing, Yassamin isn't stopping at making history here in AZ-03. She and her team are working overtime to turn out Democrats across Arizona so that we can keep our state blue.

That\u2019s the amount I am humbly asking you to give to my campaign to help me defeat Lauren Boebert. Yep, just $5. $5 because last year, Adam Frisch lost to Lauren Boebert by just 546 votes. $5 because now Lauren Boebert has moved to my district, and I am the Democratic nominee running against her. $5 because the polling shows Boebert is still incredibly vulnerable and in danger of losing! And $5 because if we turn this seat blue, Democrats are almost guaranteed to take back the House \u2013 and that\u2019s why Lauren Boebert and Speaker Johnson\u2019s Super PACs are attacking me. I know $5 might not seem like much \u2013 and to be honest, it\u2019s not. But over 75,000 grassroots donors like you have already chipped in to my campaign, and we are building a grassroots movement to defeat Lauren Boebert \u2013 $5 at a time. We cannot stop or let up now. Not when we are so close to giving Boebert the boot. My campaign has set a goal to raise another $30,000 to fight back and defeat Lauren Boebert, but we are still extremely far away with time running out before our critical fundraising deadline. **Please, can I count on you to make a donation to my campaign right now \u2013 no amount is too small \u2013 to help me defeat Lauren Boebert, flip this seat blue, and take back the House for Democrats?** _Please use the links in this email to start a weekly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  I have been so humbled by the massive outpouring of support my campaign hasgotten from people like you all across the country.But I\u2019m not taking money from corporate PACs, so I need your continued supportnow if we\u2019re going to win and finally defeat Lauren Boebert.Thank you \u2013 from the bottom of my heart,Trisha  ********Paid for by Trisha 4 ColoradoTrisha 4 Colorado PO Box 630633 Highlands Ranch, CO 80130Contributions or gifts to Trisha 4 Colorado are not tax deductible.This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

The vast majority of people who read this email won\u2019t give; they\u2019ll lookthe other way. We\u2019re hoping you\u2019re different. As a matter of fact, we need youto be different. As you read this, Ruben is being outspent on television inArizona. After months of missed goals, we haven\u2019t raised what we need tocompete. Kari Lake has more resources at her disposal than we do, and we arefalling behind. The way we retake the momentum is you. If everyone readingthis donated just $5, we would not only fully fund our advertising in thisfinal week. We would not only receive a historic number of donations. We wouldturn this election upside down. We\u2019d raise enough to defeat Kari Lake. UnlikeKari, Ruben can\u2019t depend on a handful of billionaires to bail this campaignout. We\u2019re sustained by the donations of less than 5% of Ruben\u2019s supporters.Without those donations, big or small, we wouldn\u2019t have a chance. That\u2019s whywe need your help. We\u2019re passionate about the way we fundraise becauseultimately this campaign is powered by you. But this late in the race, theonly tool we have to close the gap with Kari Lake and win is with yoursupport.

This is one of the last opportunities we have tobreak through before Election Day on Tuesday, so we\u2019ll get straight to thepoint: We\u2019re asking you to contribute to Ruben\u2019s campaign before that deadlinehits. The vast majority of people who read this email won\u2019t give; they\u2019ll lookthe other way. We\u2019re hoping you\u2019re different. As a matter of fact, we need youto be different. As you read this, Ruben is being outspent on television inArizona. After months of missed goals, we haven\u2019t raised what we need tocompete. Kari Lake has more resources at her disposal than we do, and we arefalling behind. The way we retake the momentum is you. If everyone readingthis donated just $5, we would not only fully fund our advertising in thisfinal week. We would not only receive a historic number of donations. We wouldturn this election upside down. We\u2019d raise enough to defeat Kari Lake. UnlikeKari, Ruben can\u2019t depend on a handful of billionaires to bail this campaignout. We\u2019re sustained by the donations of less than 5% of Ruben\u2019s supporters.Without those donations, big or small, we wouldn\u2019t have a chance. That\u2019s whywe need your help. We\u2019re passionate about the way we fundraise becauseultimately this campaign is powered by you. But this late in the race, theonly tool we have to close the gap with Kari Lake and win is with yoursupport. If defeating Kari Lake and holding control of the U.S. Senate seemsworth a donation to you, please take a moment to secure the future of ourdemocracy by chipping in.

The best way to send principled leaders to Washington is to donate to their campaigns through the Senate Conservatives Fund. You can contribute to multiple candidates with a single online transaction, and SCF will pay all expenses and processing fees. This will save these candidates a mountain of money, so they can use your contributions to win votes rather than to pay fundraising costs. Here are the Senate candidates who need your urgent support: \u2713 Bernie Moreno (OH) \u2713 Eric Hovde (WI) \u2713 Sam Brown (NV) \u2713 Kari Lake (AZ) Please take action right now by making a split contribution to their conservative Senate campaigns.

Please contribute to these four candidates today! We will combine your donations with those made by thousands of other patriots and transfer them directly to their campaigns.
