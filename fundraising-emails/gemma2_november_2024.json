In 2022, Adam Frischnearly defeated Lauren Boebert. He lost by just 546 votes. That scared LaurenBoebert so much that she came running to my district. But the voters ofeastern Colorado don\u2019t want a carpetbagging extremist more concerned withgetting on Fox News than the needs of her constituents. Even Republicans aredone with Boebert: 57% voted for someone else in the primary! We can finallykick Lauren Boebert out of Congress in November, but the only way I\u2019ll be ableto win is if we hit every fundraising goal and have the resources to fullyfund my campaign. We\u2019ve set a goal of raising another $250,000 before ourfinal end-of-month fundraising deadline, but right now, we\u2019re still incrediblyshort. So I have to ask: Please, if you can afford to, will you make adonation to my campaign \u2013 every dollar you can spare \u2013 to help me defeatLauren Boebert?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Every dollar you give today will bring us one step closer to finally sendingLauren Boebert packing, and truly no amount you can afford is too small.

That\u2019s why I am so excited about Trisha\u2019s campaign: **New polling shows that Trisha can win and defeat Lauren Boebert! But Trisha can only flip this seat blue if she is able to raise enough money and fully fund her campaign.** I\u2019m ready to help Trisha Calvarese take on Lauren Boebert and finally kick her out of Congress, and I am asking you to join me today: **Please, will you make a donation right now to Trisha Calvarese\u2019s campaign to help her defeat Lauren Boebert this November? Winning this seat and turning it blue not only means getting rid of Boebert, but it will also get us one step closer to taking back the House for Democrats.** _Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  This election is about integrity and decency.

        "body": "Peter, Friday November 1st marks the 3rd day of early voting here in Oklahoma.So what are the three things you need to know? First of all, there just sohappen to be 3 judges of the Oklahoma Supreme Court on the ballot. And theyare ALL liberal. They are all THREE appointed by Democrat Governors. And wehave the chance to remove all three at once. If WE vote NO on all threeliberal Supreme Court judges, they will be removed and can no longer be ableto force their liberal agenda on Oklahoma. The question on your ballot will beif Edmonson, Gurich, & Kauger should be retained in their current positions.And the answer is NO, they should not be retained. All three must go, so wemust all VOTE NO! Secondly, you\u2019ll be voting on several candidates beyond justthe President. We can all compare the economic boom with 4 years of PresidentTrump to the disastrous 4 years under Biden-Harris. If your mind isn\u2019t alreadymade up on who to vote for as President think of how much better off you were4 years ago & realize we can have that again. There are other candidates onthe ballot, so the easiest way to vote is to choose \u201cRepublican\u201d straightparty voting. That\u2019ll make your selection for all those races & help put inRepublicans at the State & local level to help restore our economy & keep moremoney in your pockets. And third, you\u2019ll also have two State Questions on yourballot. SQ833 creates new tax structures. Many people are torn on how to votefor this, but we\u2019ll just put out there that we don\u2019t believe the governmentneeds MORE ways to tax us. If you agree we don\u2019t need more tax options, you\u2019llvote no on this one. As for SQ834 it would clarify that ONLY citizens can votein Oklahoma elections. It\u2019s obvious part of the Biden-Harris open border planis to get more people voting, including non-citizens. In fact a dozen citiesalready allow non-citizens to vote INCLUDING Washington DC! We must secure ourelections by allowing ONLY citizens to vote. Otherwise liberal court judges(refer to the first item listed above!) will allow law-breaking foreigners tovote in our elections. So there you have it, the three things you need toknow. 1) Vote no on all THREE Supreme Court judges. 2) Vote Republicanstraight party. 3) On the State Questions vote for lower taxes & ONLY citizensvoting. -Team OKGOP -=-=- Paid for by OKGOP and not authorized by anycandidate or candidate's committee. www.OKGOP.com - (405) 528-3501. 4031 N.Linconln Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK 73105 This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.

It\u2019s not always glamorous,but I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world \u2013 it\u2019s the job you hired me to do. Fromhelping address the cost of living to speaking on the Senate floor in defenseof women\u2019s rights, this work is incredibly rewarding. I can\u2019t wait to keepfighting for you and your communities in the Senate if you give me theopportunity. But friend, I need your support \u2013 large or small, it doesn\u2019tmatter \u2013 if I\u2019m going to win my re-election campaign in November. Can you makea donation large or small to be split between myself and Sen. Blumenthal rightnow? With the clock ticking, I promise every single dollar counts.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/blumenthal-email-2024-king?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk1383-bu-text Politics aremore divisive than ever. Partisan bickering and extremism have become the newnormal. But I truly think that we Americans agree on far more than we disagreeon, and we should find common-sense solutions that work for everyone. Everyday I go to work in the Senate, I aim to rise above that partisanship to fightfor the solutions that benefit all Americans. Are you with me? \u2014Angus --------This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

Thank you, Nella Domenici Help Elect Nella and Secure the Border \u00bb ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

But we can\u2019t take anything for granted. This race willbe razor-close, and it could determine control of the House for the next twoyears. These last few days are vital for our efforts to get out the vote onTuesday.

Andthanks to folks like you, my campaign has been able to compete with millionsof dollars from our opponent\u2019s super PAC allies. But here\u2019s the blunt truth:If IL-17 flips red, chances are that Congress will flip red, too.

Whenever Trump gets near a microphone, it\u2019s almost a given that he\u2019s going to attack me. At a MAGA rally in California, Trump threatened to withhold federal assistance for wildfires, attacked me personally, and urged his supporters to back GOP candidates across California. On Fox News, Trump rolled out a dangerous new attack, calling me the \u201cenemy within,\u201d claiming that I\u2019m even more dangerous than foreign adversaries. He even threatened to use the military against me for holding him accountable. His goal is simple, Derek: sabotage my campaign and silence anyone standing in his way. It\u2019s clear Trump and his allies still see me as a threat \u2014 and the closer we get to Election Day, the worse and more frequent the attacks will become. I don\u2019t take a dime from corporate PACs, so it will take a movement of grassroots supporters to overcome Trump and his allies\u2019 attacks.

First the New YorkTimes lied about my childhood and family, and now CNN is lying about mybusiness record. And what\u2019s worse, they are doing it all because I\u2019m withinstriking distance of an entrenched career politician, Bob Casey, in the #1swing state in the nation that will determine control of the U.S Senate. BobCasey is getting Leftist news sources to do his dirty work, and I WON\u2019TTOLERATE IT. Here's the truth: this is a long message and I hope you will readall the way to the end. I grew up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. We lived oncampus at Bloomsburg State College and my parents owned a farm ten minutesdown the road. I had summer jobs baling hay and trimming Christmas trees atnearby farms. My dad started his career teaching history, economics, &democracy at Punxsutawney High. My mom began teaching fourth through sixthgraders at a public school near Pittsburgh. I\u2019m incredibly proud that my dadwas chosen to be president of Bloomsburg State College (now BloomsburgUniversity) at only 34 years old. I\u2019m so proud of my parents\u2019 teachingcareers and to have been raised in Bloomsburg. It was there that I wrestledand played football and was nominated to the U.S. Military Academy at WestPoint. And it was there that I came home to a parade after serving in combatduring the Gulf War. After the Army, I earned a Ph.D. in internationalrelations before moving to Pittsburgh to start a career in business. I workedmy way up to become the CEO of FreeMarkets, a successful tech startup thatemployed hundreds in Western Pennsylvania. I was then called to serviceagain, this time in the highest levels of government as Under Secretary ofTreasury and as Deputy National Security Advisor. Following this, I joinedBridgewater Associates, one of the largest, most successful investment firmsin the world, which manages the pension plans of groups including teachers,firefighters and law enforcement. I have lived the American Dream, and I amrunning for Senate to bring my decades of experience and love for our countryto fix our broken economy that is a direct result of policies supported by myopponent, who has spent 18 years in Washington with NOTHING to show for it. Iknew getting into this race could mean things would get nasty, but it\u2019s sad tosee we\u2019ve fallen so far that these media outlets like the New York Times andCNN are pushing the Democrats\u2019 baked narrative about my upbringing and mybusiness record. I\u2019ve opened myself and my family up to attacks from theleft, and every day feels like a battle. But I\u2019m no stranger to fighting forwhat is right andif we don\u2019t elect leaders to go to DC to clean up the messthe career politicians made, we will lose America as we know it! Here\u2019s whereI need your help, Fellow Patriot. We need to combat these lies with the TRUTHabout me. The Democrats are seeing the same polls you and I see. They know ifKamala Harris and Bob Casey lose Pennsylvania, they lose it ALL, and they aregoing to do WHATEVER IT TAKES to try and defeat me. I hate asking for money \u2014I\u2019m not a career politician, and it\u2019s not in my nature \u2014 but I have no choicebut to ask if we\u2019re going to hit our fundraising goal for the final stretch ofthe campaign.Will you chip in $30 or more right now to fight back against thelies from the Left? Chuck Schumer and his allies are working overtime toobliterate my campaign. They have committed to spend whatever it takes todefeat me.They know if I win this race in Pennsylvania, it\u2019ll be IMPOSSIBLEfor Democrats to keep their majority in the Senate. If we don\u2019t show theDemocrats we can win this race, it\u2019s game over. That\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping you canspare$29, $50, or even $100 to help me fight back against the lies.

She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Jacky Rosen and I believe in a future where every personhas the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. Where no child hasto grow up in poverty. Where every worker has the freedom to join a union.Where every person has affordable health care, child care, and paid leave.Where every senior can retire with dignity. But Donald Trump and his extremistRepublican allies want to take our country backward. They intend to cut SocialSecurity and Medicare, to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporationsand to make working families foot the bill, and end the Affordable Care Act.America has tried these failed policies before. We are not going back.Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, the batonis in our hands. To protect the right to vote. To get assault weapons off ofour streets. To restore reproductive freedom, reversing Donald Trump's extremeabortion bans. Jacky Rosen is running for reelection to continue deliveringfor Nevadans. In the Senate, she has never hesitated to take on powerfulspecial interests to bring down costs for hardworking Nevada families.

Two of the most important congressional races in the nation are happening right here in our state. Next door to our district in AZ-01, Dr. Amish Shah has the chance to finally beat David Schweikert and flip a critical battleground seat blue. Schweikert is a MAGA die-hard who helped write the Trump tax cuts, which gave billionaires and big corporations a $1.9 trillion tax break. He's also an anti-choice fanatic who once said that women who have abortions \"hate our country.\" And in AZ-06, Kirsten Engel is running to flip a seat that went red by just 5,232 votes in 2022. Peter, winning these frontline races may be the difference between retaking the House and falling short. We need your help to elect Democrats up and down the ballot here in AZ. Can we count on you to split a contribution between our three races before midnight tonight, when we close the books on our final monthly fundraising deadline of this race?

But this year, Kirsten is facing an incredibly tough fight at the ballot box. Democrats are defending a massive 23 seats, meaning our grassroots resources are spread incredibly thin. And in 2022, New York saw the biggest red wave across the country. Now, those same extremists are working overtime to defeat Kirsten and retake control of the Senate. There's no way Kirsten backs down from this fight.

That's what makes her such an incredible advocate for Americans around the country (and one of the most powerful allies that you can have here in the Senate). Now, more than ever, New Yorkers, Democrats, and all Americans need Kirsten's bold voice in Congress. Because today, our most fundamental rights are under unprecedented attack from extremist Republicans. We're in a national emergency for our democracy and all of the values we hold dear. Kirsten and I are fighting every day to safeguard these rights. We're working to pass voting rights legislation that will ensure every single American has equal, unrestricted access to the ballot box. And we're rallying support to certify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would give us a legal basis to restore reproductive rights nationwide. But to continue these fights, and save our Senate majority, Kirsten needs your help: The only way to defeat the GOP's megadonors is with strong grassroots support from folks like you.

There's a strong chance it will all come down to Ohio, which meansSherrod is the ONLY thing standing between us and a Republican Senate. Friend,I've worked on campaigns for a long time. I've been on the winning side andthe losing side. If there's one thing I know, it's that money makes a BIGdifference. I wish it weren't the case, but it is. TV ads, phone banks, yardsigns, campaign events in every corner of the state \u2013 it all adds up FAST.That's why I'm so terrified right now. If this were a simple battle betweengood and evil, I wouldn't be worried \u2013 Sherrod is as good a leader as Ohioanshave ever had. He fights harder for workers than anybody I know, and he's notafraid to take on the big banks and corporations that are making things harderfor the middle class. But money muddies the waters, and his opponent has got aton of it. He's poured A TON into his own campaign, and there's a lot morewhere that came from. Sherrod simply doesn't have that kind of money \u2013 sothat's where this grassroots team needs to come in and have his back, friend.I know Sherrod can win this critical race and keep the Senate blue, but ONLYIF we all come together to give him the resources he needs.

As asitting senator from Georgia, I'll always put working families and smallbusinesses first, friend.

Six days from rightnow, voters will decide the future of America. I'm looking at the early votetotals and I'll be completely upfront with you\u2026 I'm beyond worried. I'mpetrified. The Democrat voter turnout/ballot harvesting machine is chargingfull speed ahead to rob Donald Trump of the presidency, steal the House, andhold the line in the Senate. At this point, we could wake up on November 6thto a full Democrat takeover of America. That's why President Trump and I areworking hand in glove to save the country.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bI'm campaigning on stage with him. I'm traveling to swing states like Michiganto turn out voters. And I'm rallying Republican voters in Tennessee and beyondto win. The only problem is I'm about $80,000 short of my fundraising goalright now. I'm scared that if I don't make up the lost ground, I'll have toshut down our voter turnout operation for the final stretch of the election. Ididn't want to burden you with this but I'm out of options. I'm forced to cometo you - with my hat in hand - to plead with you for help. If you can spareeven a few dollars, it would mean a great deal to me.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bCONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT If you canhttps://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bpitch in $100 - $250, it would make a huge dent in my budget shortfall andchange everything.

If every Conservative gave at leastthis much, the Democrats would be out of power for a generation. All I ask isthat you donate something before Election Day.

She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant.

Iknow it\u2019s getting late, but I wanted to reach out one last time before themonth ends. Right now, with just hours left until our final end-of-monthdeadline of the campaign, we\u2019re just shy of hitting $30,000. Peter, I don\u2019tthink I need to emphasize just how critical TX-15 is. This is the SOLEcompetitive House race in the state of Texas, and what we do here will definethe road to the House majority on November 5. Not to mention I\u2019m up againstMonica De La Cruz, who is as MAGA extremist, anti-choice, anti-seniors, anti-workers, anti-Texas as they come. Now what\u2019s spookier than that? With exactly5 days left until the election, we can\u2019t afford a single misstep or risk. Wehave to win this thing, folks \u2014 the future of Texas and democracy at largedepends on it. And if we\u2019re going to make that happen, we need ALL theresources possible to supercharge our campaign.

The onlything left that Debbie needs to win is a sizable grassroots cash infusion overthe last 5 days \u2014 especially before her last $10 million end-of-month deadlinetonight.

Your generosity has allowed us to build a top-notchteam, craft cutting-edge campaigns, and fight the Democrat machine.  But I know that our success isn't just about House Republicans - **it's aboutthe countless hours you've volunteered, your thoughtful survey responses, andthe contributions you've given to fuel our movement. You're the unsung hero ofour party, and I'm honored to stand alongside you in this fight.**  Now, as we sprint to the finish line, I need your help one more time if youcan spare a few dollars.  **We're facing a fierce battle in the final days of this election, and everydollar counts.

It will help usdefend our vulnerable incumbents, _flip key seats, and elect a new generationof conservative leaders._  If you can swing it, one last contribution would mean the world to me, but ifnot, please don't stress, you've done so much for us already.

Ithought that would be the end of the damage\u2026 But with the election rightaround the corner, Kamala\u2019s Deep State truly wants to ruin me with all they\u2019vegot. They\u2019re now considering dealing one final blow to me. A judge may noworder me to give up my remaining home in Florida \u2013 my primary residence. As mylawyer inquired: do they truly want me homeless? Over the last few days, we\u2019veheard ridiculous claims about President Trump being a \u201cfascist.\u201d Let me tellyou what fascism is\u2026 Fascism is weaponizing the legal system to punish yourpolitical opponents. Fascism is having your home taken from you. Fascism istaking the law license away from your opponent\u2019s lawyer. Fascism is trying toturn your enemies into political prisoners. I am living through theDemocrats\u2019 fascism right now. I sincerely pray that freedom, justice, and thetruth prevail on Tuesday, November 5 \u2013 or the damage done to me will spreadlike wildfire to the rest of our great Republic. But, as I wrote to you in anearlier letter, the Bible reminds us that our earthly possessions will alwaysfade, but greater \u201cheavenly treasures\u201d await us. The pursuit of truth,freedom, and justice are worth infinitely more than a car or a home.Possessions come and go, but I couldNEVER SURRENDER my fight for freedom andfor what I know to betrue.

As Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, I've had theprivilege of traveling the country, working with our candidates, and seeingyour impact firsthand. Your generosity has allowed us to build a top-notchteam, craft cutting-edge campaigns, and fight the Democrat machine.  But I know that our success isn't just about House Republicans - **it's aboutthe countless hours you've volunteered, your thoughtful survey responses, andthe contributions you've given to fuel our movement. You're the unsung hero ofour party, and I'm honored to stand alongside you in this fight.**  Now, as we sprint to the finish line, I need your help one more time if youcan spare a few dollars.  **We're facing a fierce battle in the final days of this election, and everydollar counts. That's why I'm humbly asking you to make a final contributionto help defend our razor-thin House Majority.**  Your donation will go directly towards our Get Out the Vote efforts,advertising, and other key pieces of our campaign operation. It will help usdefend our vulnerable incumbents, _flip key seats, and elect a new generationof conservative leaders._  If you can swing it, one last contribution would mean the world to me, but ifnot, please don't stress, you've done so much for us already.

UnlikeRick Scott, I don't have a massive fortune at my campaign's disposal. I comefrom a working-class family, so I know my eye-watering $4 million goal isnothing to shake a stick at. But it's the only way I'll be able to defeat him.If that's all you need to hear, please click here to chip in $10 now \u2014 but I'dlike to share what your hard-earned $10 means to me.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text See, my family moved to the United States from Ecuador with big dreamsfor a better life when I was 14. But it didn't come easy, and despite my momworking back-to-back double shifts, we still struggled to afford rent on ourone room apartment. So once I turned 15, I began taking early morning shiftsat a doughnut shop before school. It wasn't much, but the extra cash gave myfamily room to breathe, and eventually, the life we dreamt of finally cametrue. But I'm not the only one who got their start in the doughnut business.When he was a young man, my opponent, Rick Scott, bought two doughnut shops.While I made minimum wage to help keep the lights on at home, he reaped thebenefits of his employees' hard work. For me, those $10 boxes of doughnutswere a lifeline that helped my family get by. For him, they kicked off acareer in penthouse C-suites. And with your $10, you can help me kick Rick outof the Senate on election night \u2014 so please, pitch in now.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text I went on to graduate college, fight to improve life for working familieslike my own, and become the first South American immigrant elected toCongress. Rick Scott went on to enrich himself off U.S. taxpayers via thelargest Medicare fraud scheme in history, amass a nine-figure fortune, and buyhis way into the Senate. So I don't take your help toward reaching my $4million goal lightly. There's simply no way I could ever do it on my own. Myopponent, however, can spend $4 million to get his ads on screens withoutthinking twice \u2014 and he has already spent plenty more to stop me. So the onlyway we'll get him out and give working Floridians the Senate representation wedeserve is if we hit my $4 million goal. Please, friend: Will you give just$10 \u2014 about the cost of a dozen doughnuts \u2014 to help me retire Rick Scott?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text This campaign is powered by small-dollar donations, so every cent makes abig difference.

Can I count on you to step up with a split donation of $10 today to ensure my team and I have the resources we need to push back against the $40 million worth of attack ads Ted Cruz and his allies are running against us right now? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Last time around, Ted Cruz won his race by just over 2% of the vote \u2013 that was a difference of about 215,000 votes, friend. I remember how it felt watching the results roll in on November 6, 2018, and let me tell you, it was a nail-biter. I have no doubts that this year will be when we finally send Ted Cruz packing. But despite being closer than ever to defeating Ted, we've still got a lot more work to do and only a handful of days left to do it. I know seeing a number like $500,000 can feel overwhelming, but if thousands of hardworking folks like you chip in $5 here, $25 there, and the occasional $100, we will be able to collectively reach this critical goal. So please, will you chip in a split donation between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's of $10 or whatever you can afford now so I can hit my daily fundraising goal and flip Texas blue? We've got zero time left to go, so let's get it done, friend! https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thanks for being on my team, Colin Allred -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

Your generosity has allowed us to build a top-notchteam, craft cutting-edge campaigns, and fight the Democrat machine.  But I know that our success isn't just about House Republicans - **it's aboutthe countless hours you've volunteered, your thoughtful survey responses, andthe contributions you've given to fuel our movement. You're the unsung hero ofour party, and I'm honored to stand alongside you in this fight.**  Now, as we sprint to the finish line, I need your help one more time if youcan spare a few dollars.  **We're facing a fierce battle in the final days of this election, and everydollar counts. That's why I'm humbly asking you to make a final contributionto help defend our razor-thin House Majority.**  Your donation will go directly towards our Get Out the Vote efforts,advertising, and other key pieces of our campaign operation. It will help usdefend our vulnerable incumbents, _flip key seats, and elect a new generationof conservative leaders._  If you can swing it, one last contribution would mean the world to me, but ifnot, please don't stress, you've done so much for us already.

My team just let me know that we came up short of our October fundraising goal last night. This was always going to be an uphill battle. We had to raise our goals multiple times throughout the month to keep up with the tens of millions of dollars Republicans continue to spend on brutal attack ads against me. Now, I won\u2019t tell you that the sky is falling because we missed this goal. But I will tell you the truth, which is that we\u2019re starting November with a significant gap in our budget. That\u2019s a problem because if we need to cut back on our campaign ads or get-out-the-vote efforts this late in the race, Republicans could easily flip this battleground seat. Staying competitive in this toss-up race isn\u2019t as easy for me as tapping into a multimillion-dollar personal fortune like my opponent can. Instead, I rely on folks like you who pitch in what you can, when you can, to help power our campaign.

Can you chip in another $10 today to keep our campaigncruising on the path to victory? For American Greatness! Bernie Moreno GOPNominee for Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fights for theAmerican Dream because he\u2019s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota, Colombia. Atage five, his American Dream began when he moved to the United States with hisfamily. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Through his relentlesswork ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned the first cardealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largest dealership groupsin America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value and transformationalpotential of blockchain technology, before it received mainstream attention,and moved much of his volunteer time and investment dollars into the space. In2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to be quite successful as Bernieserved as Chairman of the Board. After a long, successful career, Bernie soldmost of his business to begin focusing on his calling: protecting the Americandream for another generation. Solving our country\u2019s problems requires commonsense. In Washington, Bernie will fight to shrink government, protect ourfreedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party from taking our data and land, andalways put America First. Ohioans are done with politicians who talk a biggame and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. to get work done \u2013 just likehe always has.

We all know it. The only people who can afford to runfor Senate full-time are millionaires like my opponent, Republican DebFischer. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the only people who ever win. It\u2019s why the Senateis just another country club full of Ivy League graduates, former businessexecs, and trust fund babies. Working people like me, we can\u2019t afford to giveup our jobs to run for office. During this campaign, I\u2019ve been working 40, 60,sometimes 90 hours a week as a steamfitter just to pay our bills and put foodon the table. How\u2019s anybody with a real job supposed to campaign and win whenyour opponent is wealthy enough to not work at all? That\u2019s why I announcedthat I was taking a leave from my job as a steamfitter to campaign full-timefor the U.S. Senate and keep up our momentum. And yes, that means I\u2019m going toneed to take a salary from our campaign. Not a big one. Just enough to replacethe $48,000 I got paid last year and the cost of health care for me and myfamily. Politics shouldn\u2019t only be for the rich, and this is the only way wecan change that. Five brand-new polls show me narrowly LEADING my opponent,Republican Deb Fischer \u2013 and according to FiveThirtyEight, this is now theCLOSEST Senate race in the country. With support from grassroots donors likeyou, we out-raised Fischer, but Mitch McConnell is spending over $13.1 millionon TV ads attacking me. Together, we are charting the path for how a bluecollar, union worker can run for U.S. Senate \u2013 and win. But I need grassrootsdonors like you to chip in to my campaign right now if we\u2019re going to defeatRepublican Deb Fischer and flip this Senate seat: Please, will you make adonation to my campaign right now \u2013 no amount you can afford is too small \u2013 tohelp me defeat Republican Deb Fischer and flip this Senate seat in November?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]I\u2019m not rich.

NowI\u2019m known for making some pretty bold statements, but this is no exaggeration:Rick Scott is pushing an agenda so extreme, even Mitch McConnell wants nothingto do with it. I\u2019m talking about ending Social Security and Medicare, raisingtaxes on working families, a national ban on abortions, and so much more. I\u2019mscared half to death thinking about what could happen if we give this guy 6more years in Washington \u2014 especially with MAGA extremists on the cusp ofretaking the Senate. But right now, Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is fallingdangerously short of her LAST $4 million fundraising goal ahead of ElectionDay. I\u2019m asking you to take the gloves off and go on the offensive with me:Please, will you donate $5 or more to help Debbie flip Florida blue and saveour Senate majority?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2463-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Listen, just about anyone can see that a bluewave is building in Florida. As folks from all across the state rally behindDebbie\u2019s campaign, polling data shows that this race against extremist RickScott is a dead heat. And that barely scratches the surface: Even with theextreme abortion ban officially in effect, Florida Democrats secured areproductive rights ballot initiative this November and won a critical specialelection, flipping a pivotal state House district from red to blue. That\u2019s whyDemocratic leaders like my friend Chuck Schumer, and even President Biden, areall in on Florida this year. They\u2019ve announced HUGE investments to make surethat voters learn the truth about Rick Scott\u2019s record. This state is ready toflip blue \u2014 but we\u2019ve all got to have Debbie\u2019s back in this fight. So I\u2019masking one final time: PLEASE, will you donate $5 or as much as you can spareright now to make sure that Debbie has everything that she needs to take onRick Scott and defeat him?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2463-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for taking the time to read thisemail.

As you may recall, Barnaby is responsible for introducing the6-week, Texas-style abortion ban in FL in the first place. We are excited toshare our endorsement of Rosemarie Latham for Florida House District 29.Polling shows that Rosemarie is closer to winning this race against herextremist, anti-choice opponent (within 3 points!!) than anyone could haveexpected.

Republican state Rep.Webster Barnaby filed the 40-page proposal \u2014 called the \"Florida HeartbeatAct\" \u2014 on Wednesday. It would prevent physicians from performing abortions ifthere is a \"detectable fetal heartbeat,\" effectively banning abortions afterabout six weeks into pregnancy, before many people even know they arepregnant. ] We have said it before and we\u2019ll say it again: MEN SHOULD NOT BEMAKING LAWS ABOUT WOMEN\u2019S BODIES! Rosemarie is a single mother of daughters.She has been a nurse for 43 years, and a nurse practitioner for 25 years. Shehas decades of experience caring for women 16 and over, including providingthem with reproductive healthcare. Through this experience, she has directlyengaged in the triumphs and challenges of our healthcare system and has seenthe ripple effect on people\u2019s lives. \u201cThe exam room isn\u2019t big enough to fitme, my patient, and Florida\u2019s government.\u201d This is why Rosemarie chose to runfor office. Because she is determined to do everything she can for women\u2019shealth and safety. The same cannot be said about her opponent. We are sick andtired of men making dangerous laws about our bodies and our lives. We areworking hard to restore abortion access in Florida.

Thisyear\u2019s election is another challenge for us to meet: In Montana\u2019s Senate race,Jon Tester is running against Mitch McConnell\u2019s handpicked candidate.

Everything we\u2019ve worked toward comes down to these final moments \u2014 and I want to take a moment to say thank you for standing with me every step of the way. This journey has been full of challenges and hard work \u2014 from mobilizing voters and supporting Democratic candidates here in California and the rest of the country to the attacks from Trump and his MAGA allies. Through it all, I\u2019ve been inspired by the way this team has rallied behind me and the issues that matter most to them and their families. Your unwavering support has made all of this possible \u2014 and now we\u2019re just days away from the finish line. We have the opportunity to keep the Senate blue, flip the House, and ensure we can move forward together \u2014 every conversation, every volunteer, every dollar raised, and every vote counts in this work. It\u2019s not just about what we\u2019re fighting against \u2014 it\u2019s about what we\u2019re fighting for. So let\u2019s make sure every voter knows what\u2019s at stake and how much better our future can be. Thank you again for everything you\u2019ve done so far.

It\u2019s clear that the GOP wants to stoke fear about LGBTQ+Americans in hopes these anti-gay, anti-trans messages will win out withvoters and implement a red wave on November 5.

Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day.

So we can\u2019t leave them any room to deny thatKamala Harris will be our next President, Peter! We have to get every lastDemocrat to the polls, turn out a record number of voters to support her, andget a Blue Wave going from the White House down! But we can\u2019t win without you.Right now, Kamala and Trump are locked in a neck-and-neck race to the finishline, Democrats are at risk of losing the Senate, and so much is on the lineon Election Night. Can we count on you to chip in $15 or more to Blue AmpAction today so we can invest in getting Kamala and other key Democratselected? Your support will allow us to send money where it\u2019s needed most,combat misinformation, and show Trump once and for all that the Americanpeople REJECT him and his extremist views. Your support will give Democratsthe momentum they need to pull ahead in this critical moment and WIN. Soplease, Peter, can you chip in any amount to Blue Amp Action today?

Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day. So our kids grow up in democracy, not dystopia. Thank you for your support for all we do!

So I wanted to take a few minutes to tell you about my decision to run for president \u2013 and why your support for the DLCC and my campaign is so important to our success on Election Day in four days. Before I continue, if you\u2019re short on time, will you split a donation between the DLCC and my campaign at my personal link below? https://dlcc.org/dlcc-hfp **The truth is: I am no stranger to unlikely journeys.** Where I grew up in the Bay, you either live in the hills or the flatlands. We lived in the flats. It was a working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the civil rights movement, and at a young age I decided I wanted to be a lawyer. I wanted to protect people because I believe everyone has a right to safety, dignity, and justice. Today, my decision to run for president has everything to do with this opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past. We have the chance to chart a new way forward \u2013 not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans. I want you to know that I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens, who is realistic, practical, and has common sense. A president who always fights for the American people. I cannot do it alone. No one person could. It takes a team. It takes millions and millions of people coming together at once to shape the outcome of this election and elect Democrats up and down the ballot. If we are going to win this election and elect Democrats in swing districts across our country, I need you to step up and join this team. Millions of Americans have already voted, and millions more will vote on Election Day. And we need to do everything we can \u2013 and I mean everything \u2013 to reach every last voter to win the White House and elect Democrats to state legislatures across the country. **So, with time running out to make an impact before Election Day, I am asking for your support one last time:** Will you help us get out the vote over these final days by splitting $10, or whatever you can afford, between the DLCC and my campaign before our midnight deadline? Every dollar will help us reach more voters and elect Democrats in key swing districts before the polls close on Election Day. | If you've stored your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately and be split between DLCC PAC and the Harris-Walz campaign.  --- | $10 \u00bb --- | $25 \u00bb --- | $50 \u00bb --- | $100 \u00bb --- | $250 \u00bb --- | Other \u00bb ---  From the bottom of my heart: Thank you for everything.

Since Gianforte becamegovernor, Raph has blocked more than a dozen different unconstitutional lawsthat invaded Montanans\u2019 constitutional rights.

You might be asking yourself, \u201cwhat can four quarters possibly do?\u201d Well, here\u2019s what your $1 can do: $1 can protect abortion rights, Social Security, and affordable health care from being dismantled by Tammy\u2019s right-wing opponent. $1 can help defend our razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate from Republicans and their extremist agenda. $1 can help our campaign fight back against the $100 million worth of ads Republicans and right-wing super PACs have poured into Wisconsin \u2014 turning this into the most expensive Senate race in our state\u2019s history. We get it \u2014 $1 may not seem like it could make a difference, especially up against Republican dark money donors and a self-funding megamillionaire who has poured $20 million of his personal fortune toward flipping this seat red. But this close to Election Day in the most competitive Senate race in the country, every single dollar makes a real difference \u2014 especially when tens of thousands of supporters step up to support Tammy\u2019s reelection campaign.

We\u2019ve got an incredible candidate for Senate. We\u2019ve gotcompetitive congressional districts across the Commonwealth. And we\u2019ve got theenergy on the ground to make those victories happen \u2014 if we act. Virginiaisn\u2019t just our surprise swing state this year. The roads to majorities inCongress could very well run right through Virginia. >>> LET\u2019S WIN VIRGINIA<<< That\u2019s why I\u2019m mobilizing resources online and on the road to reach votersand turn Virginia red in these final days. To support these efforts, we\u2019rerunning an urgent end-of-month fundraising surge to power us through ElectionDay.

Please, pitch in anything you can. >>> CHIP IN TO OURFINAL PUSH FUND NOW <<< Thank you, Jason Miyares Virginia Attorney GeneralWHO IS JASON MIYARES AND WHY IS HE WRITING TO ME? Jason Miyares is theAttorney General of Virginia \u2014 but his story doesn\u2019t start in Virginia\u2026 Itstarts in Havana, Cuba, when his mother, Miriam Miyares, fled communist Cubapenniless and homeless. She immigrated to Virginia and raised Jason toappreciate freedom, fairness, and justice for all. In 2015, almost fifty yearsto the day that she fled Cuba, Miriam was able to vote for Jason to representher in the Virginia House of Delegates. After working as a prosecutor andserving for three terms in the state legislature, he ran and was elected the48th Attorney General of Virginia. Since his inauguration in January 2022,Jason has been focused on fighting violent crime and improving public safety,strengthening economic growth, combatting the deadly impact of opioids andfentanyl, and protecting Virginians from corporate misconduct. He\u2019s beenfearless in standing up for the rule of law by challenging the Biden-HarrisAdministration whenever it tries to use lawfare to advance its radical agenda,whether it\u2019s failing to secure the border or advancing its extreme greenagenda. This year, he\u2019s not on the ballot \u2014 but the American Miracle is. JasonMiyares is laser-focused on making sure that we win Virginia this year, andthat\u2019s why he\u2019s writing to you today.Will you join Jason\u2019s team and help himturn Virginia red?

If you\u2019re way too online like me, you\u2019ve probably seen a tonof headlines about a bunch of rich guys running for Senate in states wherethey don't even live.

But this will be one ofthe toughest races of the year for Democrats. McCormick has millions uponmillions of dollars of his own to dump into this race, in addition to thebacking of Donald Trump and billionaire-funded super PACs. Pennsylvania is ascompetitive as it gets, and with the Senate majority and the White Housedepending on it, we can\u2019t take anything for granted.

Here's why: *Ohioans are already voting, and Election Day is next week \u2013 so the sooner wecan launch this final ad, the more voters we'll be able to reach before theysubmit their ballots. * We're getting drowned out on the airwaves \u2013Republicans have outspent us 3-to-1, so this final ad will punch back at theirattacks. * This final ad is going to be expensive \u2013 and we're going to run iton as many TV stations across Ohio as possible, so the more we raise, thebetter the chance we have at reaching the voters we need before Election Day.So, my team and I have set an urgent goal to raise $500,000 before midnighttomorrow to help launch this ad \u2013 my last ad before Election Day. I need yourhelp now more than ever, Peter: Please, will you rush $25 to split between mycampaign and Fight for Progress now to help us get our ad on the air, win inOhio, and keep the Senate blue?

As the lead counsel in Trump\u2019s first impeachment in 2019, I saw first-hand that democratic ideals, values and institutions are perceived by Trump as an obstacle, not an asset. But I never imagined five years ago that he would go this far. And it is certain to get worse if he wins. Before I continue, please consider pitching in any amount in the final stretch of this election. Our vital work to defend our democracy and the rule of law is more important now than ever.

As lead counsel for the Democrats during Trump\u2019s first impeachment, I helped to expose Donald Trump and his lawlessness to the American people. We proved that a corrupt president had abused the power of his office to undermine our democratic process in a bid to stay in power. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dsg-em-nov24 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dsg-em-nov24] But that abuse of power was just the tip of the iceberg. Since then, Trump has attempted to overturn a lawful election in 2020, been indicted four times and convicted of 34 felony counts for interfering in the 2016 election, used his office to make money from foreign countries, cozied up to dictators, and tried everything in his power to undermine checks and balances and the separation of powers. But his plans for a second presidency are so much more dangerous. He has stated that he\u2019d like to be a dictator, that he will use the military and the Department of Justice against anyone who disagrees with him, that he will turn the federal government into his personal fiefdom, that he will take away our individual rights and personal freedoms, and that he will support dictators over democracies around the world. Peter, we have unfinished business to save our country from Trump\u2019s authoritarian intentions. Our democracy barely survived the first Trump presidency, and it\u2019s unlikely it would survive a second. I\u2019m running for re-election because we must stop Donald Trump and the Republican Party he controls from tearing down our democracy. And I need your support. Please contribute anything you can to support my work in the last four days of this election. We cannot waste a single second in this existential fight for American democracy.

The best way to send principled leaders to Washington is to donate to their campaigns through the Senate Conservatives Fund. You can contribute to multiple candidates with a single online transaction, and SCF will pay all expenses and processing fees. This will save these candidates a mountain of money, so they can use your contributions to win votes rather than to pay fundraising costs. Here are the Senate candidates who need your urgent support: \u2713 Bernie Moreno (OH) \u2713 Eric Hovde (WI) \u2713 Sam Brown (NV) \u2713 Kari Lake (AZ) Please take action right now by making a split contribution to their conservative Senate campaigns. These races are neck-and-neck, so these candidates will need funding until Election Day to broadcast their message and turn out their voters. SUPPORT SENATE CONSERVATIVES RUSH $250 \u2192 RUSH $100 \u2192 RUSH $25 \u2192 THE BEST WAY TO FUND CONSERVATIVES Did you know that candidates often have to pay fundraising expenses that are over 80 percent of your contribution? It's true. When you respond to marketing emails and text messages from candidates, the candidates often get less than 20 percent of your donation after expenses. That's why the Senate Conservatives Fund was founded \u2013 to give freedom-loving Americans an effective way to support the best Senate candidates across the nation. Please contribute to these four candidates today! We will combine your donations with those made by thousands of other patriots and transfer them directly to their campaigns. Working together, we can build a conservative Senate that will truly advance our freedom agenda. Thank you for considering this urgent request and for doing so much to help fight for America's future!

I\u2019m fired up, Peter! The energy at President Trump\u2019s rally in Albuquerque today was palpable. I could feel it on stage while delivering my own remarks, and it was apparent to anyone who was there todaythat something special is happening in New Mexico. We\u2019re on the cusp of flipping this state red and electing new leadership that will secure our border, lower our cost of living, get tough on crime, improve education, and unleash our abundant natural resources. I need you to keep fighting every single day, every single moment, until the polls close on Tuesday. Our campaign is working 24/7 to reach remaining undecided voters and get out the vote. We need to keep resources flowing into this campaign to ensure our funding for these operations doesn\u2019t run dry. Your $5 or $10 contribution, in addition to your vote, is needed to help us secure more votes. Please chip in anything you can, and let\u2019s win this thing! Let's Flip New Mexico RED! Thank you, Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

A whopping 87% of ourfundraising comes from individual donations \u2013 NOT special interests likecorporate PACs. And we proved exactly how strong we are by outraising BrianFitzpatrick last quarter and setting a new record for Democratic fundraisingin PA-01. Ads The final case we're making to voters is Fitzpatrick's anti-choice record that has made women second-class citizens in this country. Andyes, I'm so fed up, I'm cursing in our ad.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zdb-z9KJqV0] What's Next We have just 4 DAYSLEFT until Election Day.

All three judges are very liberal (check out the score card made byOCPA scoring their liberal records ) by clicking here , and they were allappointed by Democrat Governors. They\u2019ve constantly legislated from the benchwith their decisions in order to force their liberal agenda on the people ofOklahoma.

There you can download a pdf to printat home, email to your family & friends, or distribute however you choose.Other groups have now engaged as well encouraging their people to vote NO onthese judges.

I'm respectfully asking for two minutes of your timebecause it will only take me a couple of minutes to explain the criticalmoment we're at in our race to defeat Rick Scott here in Florida. We're FOURDAYS out from the election, and I am up against my critical end-of-monthdeadline at midnight tomorrow. This comes just as Rick Scott dropped $10MILLION on ads, plus ANOTHER $3M of his own personal fortune, after newpolling showed me statistically tied with him. To pull ahead and win, I mustraise every dollar of this $4 million goal before time runs out. This is ourbest and only hope to defeat Trump puppet Rick Scott in Florida and save ourDemocratic Senate majority in the process \u2014 and we've only gotten to thispoint because grassroots supporters like you gave at critical moments likethis.

When I first ran for Congress inWisconsin, no one thought I could win \u2014 especially when an extremely popularchallenger jumped into the race. I remember huddling with one of my staffersat the time, and she said, \u201cWell Tammy, maybe you want to rethink what you\u2019redoing because it\u2019s going to be tough.\u201d I looked her right in the eye andasked, \u201cDo you think I should wait my turn?\u201d The next thing I said was this: Ibelieve that women have to run \u2014 especially when it\u2019s hard \u2014 and not wait ourturn. We can\u2019t wait until we get a tap on our shoulder or we\u2019ll never getanywhere. I ended up winning that race and became the very first woman electedto the House of Representatives from Wisconsin. And it wouldn\u2019t be the lasttime our team would make history. When I ran for U.S. Senate in 2012, anincredible team of grassroots supporters like you fought alongside me \u2014 evenas some people wrote us off. You helped me become the first woman elected tothe chamber from our state and the first openly gay Senator in our nation\u2019shistory. In 2018, despite being a top target for national Republicans andenduring over a year of attacks, you stood with me again, and we won. Time andagain, grassroots supporters like you have helped us defy the odds. The battleto protect my seat this year will be no different, with this race being mytoughest election yet. Eric Hovde and his Republican allies have already spentmore than $51 million to buy this seat and recent polls are showing this racein a dead heat. Protecting this seat won\u2019t be easy, but together, I know wecan defy the odds once again.

Governor SaraRodriguez. I'm reaching out one last time before Election Day with one simplereminder: This is one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.Wisconsin is one of the most important swing states in the country. Our 10electoral votes are some of the most important in the country, and it'scrucial that we deliver them to Kamala Harris on Election Day. And at thestate level, we have a task that's just as important: flipping the statelegislature. The new, fairer maps for this cycle give everyone the chance towin, which makes this the first time in a long time that we can win a majoritythis November. When we win next Tuesday, it'll let Governor Evers and I focuson passing our agenda that truly serves the people of Wisconsin rather thanfighting back against Republican attempts to bully working-classWisconsinites. With just a few days left in this election cycle, it's moreimportant than ever to make your voice heard at the ballot box. Whether thatmeans voting early or voting on Election Day, the most important thing is thatyou vote. I'll be doing my part this weekend, knocking on as many doors as Ican with my team\u2014can you chip in to help us cover the expenses for this lastbig GOTV push?

I know you\u2019re probably about to headoffline for the weekend, so I\u2019ll keep this quick: We need to raise $15,000this weekend to support our get out the vote efforts before Election Day. CanI count on you to pitch in and help us hit this final goal?[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/deluzioq42024email?refcode=email_110124_gotv1&amounts;=5,15,25,50,100,250]Donate \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/deluzioq42024email?refcode=email_110124_gotv1&amounts;=5,15,25,50,100,250]If you have a little more time before logging off, let me explain the stakesof this race: National Republicans have made defeating Chris a top priority.They know that the path to winning the House runs right through PA-17, andthey think that this is a toss-up race they can flip. Only 4 House seats standbetween Republicans or Democrats taking back the House. So winning in this keybattleground race puts us on the best track to winning back the House. But weneed to get out Chris\u2019s message and turn out voters before and on ElectionDay. Republicans are attacking Chris\u2019s record, but they\u2019re the ones with theagenda Western PA doesn\u2019t want. Chris\u2019s opponent supports an extreme,nationwide abortion ban, has rallied with election deniers, has voted to gutvoting rights, and wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the choppingblock. The American people don\u2019t want this kind of lunacy, chaos, andextremism. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to keep this seat soChris can continue fighting to defend our freedoms. But if we\u2019re going to beatthese extremists on Tuesday, we need to hit the ground running this weekend,and we need the money to make it happen. This is the last weekend before theelection \u2013 and your last chance to make a real impact in this race.

It\u2019s full of millionaires, formerbusiness execs, lawyers with Ivy League degrees, and trust fund kids born withso many silver spoons in their mouths that they have no idea the reality forworking-class people like me. If I defeat my opponent Republican Senator DebFischer in November, I will be the poorest member of the U.S. Senate. I don\u2019tcome from money, and I\u2019m not rich. I\u2019m a steamfitter and mechanic who works 50and 60 hour weeks to give my kids a better life. I will be the only senatorwithout a college degree. After my wife and I found out we were expecting ababy, I had to drop out and kill my dream of hanging a diploma on the wallbecause my family needed health insurance, diapers, and food on the table. Iwill be the only senator who is a blue-collar, card-carrying, union member.When Kellogg\u2019s tried to cut our benefits and workers\u2019 pay, we risked it all,went on strike, and walked the picket line for 11 weeks through the bittercold Nebraska winter. We won and saved hundreds of good-paying jobs \u2013 before Iwas fired for being the union president who led the strike. There is no onewho represents working-class people like me in the U.S. Senate. Which is whythis is such big news: Five brand-new polls show I am narrowly LEADING myopponent Republican Senator Deb Fischer. And FiveThirtyEight now says this isthe CLOSEST Senate race in the entire country! I\u2019ve taken on a big corporationbefore and won, and now I\u2019m going to defeat one of the most corporate senators\u2013 my opponent Republican Deb Fischer \u2013 and win this Senate seat. But I needyour help to do it. We\u2019ve set a goal of raising another $200,000 before ournext fundraising deadline at midnight tonight, but I\u2019m not taking money fromcorporate PACs like my opponent. If I\u2019m going to defeat Republican Deb Fischerand win this Senate seat, I need grassroots donors like you to give right now:I have nowhere else to turn. Please, will you chip in $5 or more right now \u2013every dollar you can afford before our fundraising deadline \u2013 to help medefeat Republican Deb Fischer and win this Senate seat?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101mid-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=98410eeb-7698-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101mid-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=98410eeb-7698-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101mid-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=98410eeb-7698-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101mid-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=98410eeb-7698-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101mid-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=98410eeb-7698-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101mid-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=98410eeb-7698-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101mid-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=98410eeb-7698-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]I\u2019m ready to be the 51st vote in the Senate to take on the billionaires andcorporations, fight for working-class people, and expand workers\u2019 rights \u2013 butI can\u2019t do it without you.

As you can imagine, we have been stuck in alot of traffic. It is an issue we have One thing we noticed on this campaignwas the license plates on the construction companies on I-95 and the Merritttend to be New York.

Look at the Groundbreaking last weekfor I-95 Photo- Tyler Fedor Source [ http://Tyler Fedor/The Stamford Advocate] Yonkers Contracting is based in New York. As an advocate for you, I reachedout to the press - so far, no response from the media. We are glad there aresome infrastructure improvements and most of the funds are federal but shouldwe also look to use Connecticut companies and keep more of the money in ourstate. After all they are federal tax dollars from CT residents as Connecticutonly gets back 70 cents of every federal dollar spent. A vote for me is a votefor transparency.

We see these truckseverywhere every night along the campaign trail when the roads are beingworked on for improvements. The concerns they raise are seeing New YorkLicense plates and why these are not Connecticut trucks. Have you looked into:How are these contracts awarded? If an out-of-state contractor is hired, willit use Connecticut Union Construction workers and other ancillary Connecticutresidents to participate in the construction or are all these workers New Yorkas well? If an out-of-state contractor is hired, will it use local suppliersof various materials or are all these suppliers New York as well? Whether allcontracts are awarded to the lowest bidder? Are local contractors consideredif their bid is slightly higher? How is a contractor rewarded or penalized byits previous project for change order usage as the winners always seem to bethe same? The percentage of payrolls to Connecticut residents (if any)? Thebenefit to local communities and economies in Connecticut if a localcontractor is awarded the contract? The benefits of contractor profits beingre-invested into the local economy rather than exporting profits outside of CTfor the out-of-state contractor and its out-of-state suppliers? AdditionalFees such as fuel surcharges and other distance based issues on logistics? AsClimate Change and Health Hazards associated with slow-moving traffic are alsomajor concerns, are the following also included in the calculation: Theenvironmental impact of greenhouse gas based on travel distance of workers andequipment out of state to the project site? The additional congestion of theworkforce commuting to the construction site and how it will disrupt trafficfor commuters? We have been concerned about the I-95 traffic and thechallenges to the Fairfield County corridor and now a project is starting. Wesaw the Yonkers Contracting banner and also wondered why there are noConnecticut Companies that win these bids. While most of the highway funds arefrom the Federal Government, it is still Connecticut taxpayer funds as CT hastraditionally received only 70 cents back on each federal dollar. As acandidate for Congress in Connecticut and campaigning on improving theFairfield County corridor, it is not just about improving the roads, buthaving a lasting impact on the local economies of Fairfield County andsurrounding counties that keep federally spent dollars in Connecticut. SomeLinks we have briefly assembled as this is really investigative reporting:https://www.thehour.com/news/article/i-95-delays-norwalk-westport-ctdot-bridge-replace-18404086.php [https://www.thehour.com/news/article/i-95-delays-norwalk-westport-ctdot-bridge-replace-18404086.php ]https://www.thehour.com/news/article/norwalk-i-95-fairfield-avenue-bridge-fire-crash-19525562.php [https://www.thehour.com/news/article/norwalk-i-95-fairfield-avenue-bridge-fire-crash-19525562.php ] https://www.yonkerscontractingco.com/stamford-parking [ https://www.yonkerscontractingco.com/stamford-parking ]https://newyork.news12.com/sick-of-backups-on-i-95-new-project-promises-relief[ https://newyork.news12.com/sick-of-backups-on-i-95-new-project-promises-relief ] https://www.ctinsider.com/projects/2024/news/ct-norwalk-bridge-i95-demolition/ [ https://www.ctinsider.com/projects/2024/news/ct-norwalk-bridge-i95-demolition/ ] The voters want to know why tax dollars leavefor out-of-state contractors when they know there are contractors in the State(not necessarily in the Congressional District) to do the work. We wouldappreciate your prompt attention to this matter as this is a major concern forour Voters. Traffic, Infrastructure, Climate Change and Health are on theBallot and the voter should be informed. Connecticut has also some of thehighest costs per mile for road repair and construction and our constituentsare concerned about inefficient use of taxpayer funds at the state and locallevel as poor spending hurts each resident in the pocketbook. We arethoroughly concerned about these issues. Sincerely, Dr. Michael T.

Just four more days to put our noses to the grindstone, turn out voters, and advocate for candidates that will put the needs of the many above the needs of the few. There are TONS of ways to get plugged in and help. Here\u2019s what we need you to do:  1. Join one of our final phonebanks for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz \u2014 either tonight (Friday) at 6pm ET or tomorrow (Saturday) from 11am - 1:30pm ET.   2. If you want to focus specifically on Pennsylvania \u2014 one of the most critical swing states this cycle \u2014 join our PA WFP phonebank here. We\u2019ll be hitting the phone lines on Sunday and Monday.   3. If you live in a swing state or are willing to travel to one, sign up to join a door knocking shift in key battlegrounds. Our partner, Seed the Vote, can help book transportation and housing, and offer financial support for those who need it in order to travel.   4. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, you can easily find ALL the volunteer opportunities nearby (if they exist) by **texting \"WIN\" to 30403**You all have already done SO MUCH for our movement this cycle, Peter. Allwe\u2019re asking for is one BIG push over these final four days. In solidarity,Team WFP P.S. Next Thursday from 8:00 - 9:00pm ET, we're hosting an electiondebrief Mass Call with the intention of unpacking the results, and chartingour path ahead. We'd love to see you there.

From now until Election Day, we\u2019re knocking on more doors, makingmore calls, and meeting as many voters as we can to prevent extremist NeilParrott from reaching Congress. Will you rush a contribution to help us fundour GOTV efforts across the district and defeat Neil Parrott? RUSH ACONTRIBUTION (https://secure.actblue.com/donate/blu-amdc-24q4-em?refcode=BLU_EM_AMDC_2024-11-01_2&amount;=25) This is not the newswe wanted, Peter \u2014 Our race was just downgraded by the Cook Political Report,meaning it got a lot more competitive. And with polls putting this race withinthe margin of error, what we do now could make or break the outcome. With just4 days left, that means meeting voters across the district to lay out thestakes. A Neil Parrott victory could mean: \u274cAnother vote against reproductiverights. \u274cA vote against protections for victims of domestic violence andsexual assault. \u274cAnd if Republicans don\u2019t like the outcome of the Presidentialelection, it could mean a vote for decertifying the results. We need yoursupport now more than ever to finish this race strong. Will you chip in $10,$25, or whatever you can right now?

With the stakes this high, we can\u2019t leave any stoneunturned. The good news is that there\u2019s still time for these crucial voters todeliver their mail-in ballots in person before polls close. But if we don\u2019thave the resources to fuel this final GOTV push across Florida, thousands ofDemocratic ballots could be left on kitchen counters \u2013 that\u2019s exactly what thefar-right is hoping for. So I\u2019m asking you for just $4 so we can reach as manyvoters as possible over the next 4 days.

When I was Mayor, I showed up every day and met with my staff,the City Council, and department leaders to ensure the City was doing its bestto address our challenges. What\u2019s important? Showing up to work. Yet, ViceChair Terra Lawson-Remer has failed to attend a single meeting of thehomelessness task force, despite claiming homelessness is her top priority.This task force isn\u2019t just a title; it\u2019s a critical opportunity to address ourcounty\u2019s homelessness crisis. Under Lawson-Remer\u2019s watch, homelessness(https://voiceofsandiego.org/2024/05/22/homelessness-spikes-again-in-san-diego-county/#:~:text=San%20Diego%20County's%20latest%20homeless,than%20the%20previous%20year's%20surge.)and related deaths (https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/homeless-san-diegans-are-dying-at-higher-rates-than-a-decade-ago-whats-behind-it/) havereached unprecedented levels. But instead of engaging, she\u2019s missed meetingsand critical votes\u2014neglecting her duties and abandoning core responsibilities.It\u2019s not just her\u2014her staff has failed to show up as well. Lawson-Remer haseven admitted that her representatives haven\u2019t attended meetings(https://www.nbcsandiego.com/decision-2024/san-diego-county-district-3-supervisor-race-2024/3660810/) , leaving important issuesunaddressed. In any other job, failing to attend mandatory meetings would begrounds for termination. But when it comes to serving our communities, sheexpects a pass? San Diego deserves a leader who is accountable, dedicated and,most importantly, present. I understand the urgency of San Diego\u2019shomelessness crisis and have a track record of hands-on leadership, provensolutions, and a transparent commitment to our community. I won\u2019t sit on thesidelines or turn a blind eye to the issues that affect us all just to collecta paycheck. Let\u2019s work to address the pressing challenges we face as acounty\u2014together.

When my boys were young, my husband and I were both workingfull-time. As soon as I got off the night shift from the Chapel Hill PoliceDepartment at 7am, I would go straight to my sons\u2019 classrooms to volunteer.Not only did this serve as an opportunity for me to spend more precious timewith my children, but it opened my eyes to the social disparities affectingstudents firsthand, especially Black and brown kids, in the classroom. Icouldn\u2019t stand by as students were being underserved, so after doingeverything I could do as a volunteer \u2014 I ran for School Board. On the SchoolBoard, I fought tooth and nail for better funding for our schools. Buteventually, I knew I had to run for Orange County Commissioner to makeconcrete changes. As Orange County Commissioner, I championed the constructionof two schools, two senior centers, and affordable housing initiatives \u2014 butknew the next step to securing long-term progress for our children\u2019s andcommunities\u2019 future was running for State House. I championed legislation forwomen, voting rights, and environmental protection. But, when I could donothing more as State Senator, I ran for Congress. I got into this line ofwork in pursuit of building a better life for my community and followed myheart throughout every single step. Now, there\u2019s still SO much more I can do.In just 4 days, you can send me back to Congress and keep building progressfor NC-04.

Seriously, just $5 can make aHUGE difference to our grassroots campaign. We know it might not sound likemuch when you think of the tens of millions Cruz has raised.

I know we emailed you \u2014 a lot \u2014 asking foryour help leading up to our last end-of-month fundraising deadline. And thetruth is, we really needed the help. Our end-of-month goals are alwayscrucial, but this last one was the most important by far. Hitting our Octobergoal makes the difference in having the resources we need to reach undecidedvoters and get out the vote every day for the next four days. And thanks toyou, we didn\u2019t just hit our goal, we surpassed it. Now, we have just four daysleft. That\u2019s four days to reach every undecided voter in OR-06 and tell themwhat exactly we\u2019re fighting for in this race: protecting abortion rights,defending democracy, and putting working families ahead of special interests.Friend, we need all hands on deck in these next four days. If you\u2019ve beenwaiting for a good time to chip in, now is the time to join our movement todefend OR-06.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/salinasq42024?refcode=email_110124_thank-you&amounts;=5%2C25%2C50%2C75%2C100%2C250%2C500] If you've saved your paymentinformation with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:Donate $5 \u2192[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/salinasq42024?refcode=email_110124_thank-you&amounts;=5%2C25%2C50%2C75%2C100%2C250%2C500&amount;=5&express;_lane=true]Donate $25 \u2192[secure.actblue.com/donate/salinasq42024?refcode=email_110124_thank-you&amounts;=5%2C25%2C50%2C75%2C100%2C250%2C500&amount;=25&express;_lane=true]Donate $50 \u2192[secure.actblue.com/donate/salinasq42024?refcode=email_110124_thank-you&amounts;=5%2C25%2C50%2C75%2C100%2C250%2C500&amount;=50&express;_lane=true]Donate $100 \u2192[secure.actblue.com/donate/salinasq42024?refcode=email_110124_thank-you&amounts;=5%2C25%2C50%2C75%2C100%2C250%2C500&amount;=100&express;_lane=true]Donate $250 \u2192[secure.actblue.com/donate/salinasq42024?refcode=email_110124_thank-you&amounts;=5%2C25%2C50%2C75%2C100%2C250%2C500&amount;=250&express;_lane=true]Other \u2192 [secure.actblue.com/donate/salinasq42024?refcode=email_110124_thank-you&amounts;=5%2C25%2C50%2C75%2C100%2C250%2C500] I\u2019d be lying if I said thisis going to be an easy race.

Chuck Schumer and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are now jumping into this race to rescue endangered career politician Martin Heinrich. They\u2019re funneling out-of-state dollars into New Mexico to buy up precious advertising time during the final weeks and days before Election Day. They know they were completely caught off guard when I entered this race and have been watching nervously as we\u2019ve gradually caught up to Heinrich in the polls. Now, they can\u2019t stand to sit by any longer and are frantically trying to stop our upward momentum. With New Mexico being one of the smallest states and cheapest media markets in the 2024 fight for the Senate, the money they\u2019ve raised from West and East Coast liberal elites stretches much further here,which means they can do A LOT more damage with much less. But that also means your support goes much further here, and I\u2019m asking you to help rebalance the scales and prevent Schumer and his deep-pocketed allies from buying this election at the last minute. We\u2019ve never been so close to flipping a \u201csafe blue\u201d state, and I need every bit of support you can send down the home stretch. Whether it\u2019s $5 or $500, every dollar donated at this point in the campaign helps us reach and win over undecided voters in this race. Let\u2019s keep up the fight! Nella Domenici Republican for Senate ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Growing up, I was diagnosed with a serious illness and spent three months in the hospital. When I got better, my grandparents, who raised me, wanted to make sure I was protected in case I got sick again. But they couldn\u2019t find any insurance policies that would cover me in the future. Not from any insurer. Not at any price. That meant my grandparents had to pay for my health care out of pocket, and they had to make significant sacrifices to do so \u2014 all because I had a pre-existing condition. I saw my grandparents stay up late at night, worried that I might fall ill again and that they wouldn't be able to afford my care. No one should ever have to go through that. But my story is not unique, Peter, and I knew they weren\u2019t the only ones. That\u2019s why I got into public service. I\u2019m one of 133 million Americans who have the label \"pre-existing condition\" attached to our care \u2014 and before the Affordable Care Act was passed, many of us could be denied coverage. Now, insurance companies can no longer discriminate against someone based on their pre-existing condition. I championed health reform and wrote the amendment to allow young people to stay on their parent\u2019s insurance plan up to age 26. And when I meet with young people across Wisconsin, almost every hand in the room goes up when I ask who is on their parent\u2019s health insurance. So, you can imagine my frustration whenever Republicans attack our health care and threaten protections for folks with pre-existing conditions \u2014 including my opponent Eric Hovde, who called my amendment a \u201cstupid idea\u201d and said young people on their parent\u2019s health insurance need to \u201cgrow up and move on.\u201d If Eric Hovde flips this seat and secures the Senate majority for Republicans, the ACA will be on the chopping block and countless Americans could find themselves in a place where insurance companies are putting profits over people. That\u2019s not right. And that\u2019s why I need your help to defeat him.

She's a leader of our MAGAmovement. She's a tough-as-nails Conservative. And she's a wall standing inthe way of the Democrats' radical agenda. She's also up for re-election inNovember. Normally, she would soar through the finish line since she's a topally of President Trump\u2026 but unfortunately, we have a problem. Chuck Schumerrecruited a power-hungry, showboating socialist in a desperate attempt todestroy any opposition to his agenda and defeat Marsha. In fact, Marsha'sopponent just joined forces with Hollywood elite types to turbocharge hernegative campaign to flip Tennessee. Let me say this in no uncertain terms: Ifthis radical socialist manages to flip Tennessee, our path to winning back theSenate Majority will COMPLETELY VANISH.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=251be66599936e548f530d8d1461bc84a9583a52986efa852e190bf2b52397677091d9b5af09730a78363a4a8e3c6b185f5439bf90a09dc6a72e30fb39229d97So, with all that being said, I respectfully ask you for the FIRST TIME todonate right now to Marsha Blackburn's re-election campaign.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=251be66599936e548f530d8d1461bc84a9583a52986efa852e190bf2b52397677091d9b5af09730a78363a4a8e3c6b185f5439bf90a09dc6a72e30fb39229d97PLEASE JOIN ME: DONATE NOW I don't send these types of emails very often. Ifyou're like me, these types of political emails kind of drive you crazy. Butthis is no ordinary request. Marsha Blackburn is exactly the kind of strong,patriotic conservative President Trump needs in the U.S. Senate. No surprisehere, but Marsha's socialist opponent turned to big liberal names to helpbankroll her campaign. Luckily, we have you on our side. If just 30% respondto my email, Marsha's socialist opponent will have no shot at EVER flippingthis key Senate seat. But first, I need your help right now. Please. I'mpersonally asking for your help.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=251be66599936e548f530d8d1461bc84a9583a52986efa852e190bf2b52397677091d9b5af09730a78363a4a8e3c6b185f5439bf90a09dc6a72e30fb39229d97So, I hope that's enough to convince you.

Now we have less than three weeks untilMontanans start voting. You can bet Mitch McConnell\u2019s buddies will throweverything but the kitchen sink at us to win this race. I\u2019m working torepresent rural communities and defend our Montana way of life, but I can\u2019t doit alone. If we want to win this race, then our campaign needs moresupport\u2014fast.

Ultimately, this election is about two different visions for ournation. One focused on the future . And one focused on the past . Tim Kaineand I believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just toget by, but to get ahead. Where no child has to grow up in poverty. Whereevery worker has the freedom to join a union. Where every person hasaffordable health care, child care, and paid leave. Where every senior canretire with dignity. But Donald Trump and his extremist Republican allies wantto take our country backward. They intend to cut Social Security and Medicare,to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and to make workingfamilies foot the bill, and end the Affordable Care Act. America has triedthese failed policies before. We are not going back. Generations of Americansbefore us led the fight for freedom. Now, the baton is in our hands. Toprotect the right to vote. To get assault weapons off of our streets. Torestore reproductive freedom, reversing Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans.Tim Kaine has spent his entire career fighting to improve the lives ofeveryday Virginians, and he knows there is more to be done.

Onthe ground this past month, I met people who are fired up and ready to electleaders who are prepared to use every power available to address the climatecrisis. Every state brought unforgettable moments, each one a reminder thatour future is worth fighting for. In Washington State, I joined volunteersfighting a Big Oil-backed initiative that could strip away crucialenvironmental protections. In the battleground state of Arizona, I went door-to-door to support candidates for local office and reminded folks what\u2019s atstake if Donald Trump and his allies down-ballot win. And in Michigan, Italked to voters face-to-face and shared a hug with a woman who answered thedoor with tears in her eyes. We talked about why this election matters sodeeply, and it reminded me exactly why I\u2019m in this fight. The hope and energyout there are real, and it\u2019s kept me going through this whirlwind electionseason. YOU have kept me going.

They were racist,insulting, and entirely unacceptable. Ya no mas. Any person or party whoespouses this kind of vile rhetoric against other humans \u2014 let alone citizensof the United States \u2014 is unfit to run the White House. And anyone who wouldtie themselves so closely to a candidate who does, like Rick Scott, has nobusiness in any position of power \u2014 especially in Florida. Please split $15 ormore between Blue Amp Action now to help me reach my $10 million end-of-monthgoal and build the resources to retire him from the Senate. --- | | DONATE \u2192 --- | And what's more, Peter, is that they know full-well that what they're doingis wrong \u2014 and they're terrified of facing the consequences. How am I so sure?Well, when I went to vote yesterday, I had the displeasure of running intoRick Scott myself, as he rallied Miami Republicans in a misguided attempt totry and intimidate me for social media clicks. As soon as he saw me there, hesped off in his chauffeured getaway car. Disappointing? Yes. Surprising?Hardly. It's just who he, Donald Trump, and the GOP are: Bigots, cowards, andlosers. First, Rick took a note out of Trump's playbook when he refused todebate me. Then, he comes to my home district and doesn't even have thecourage to face me, not to mention answer for his puppet-master's despicableattitudes. Now, he's panicking, and desperately trying to placate Florida'slarge Puerto Rican population, whose votes he's courting to win and stay inpower. The best way he could earn our forgiveness now is by leaving my peoplein peace, starting by staying out of politics entirely. Sadly, cowards likehim don't have the decency to do the right thing and leave us be. But with themassive fortune he used to buy the 2018 election, he won't leave without agroundswell of Florida voters saying ya no mas, too. And with just 4 days leftin this race, I won't galvanize the movement to unseat him if I can't make mycrucial $10 million goal by midnight on Thursday. In short, I can't bring himto account at the ballot box on Election Day without your grassroots support,tonight. Will you please rush $15, or anything you can spare to split withBlue Amp Action and help me flip Florida blue, retire Rick Scott, and stop theGOP's hatred from getting ahold of the Senate majority? --- | | DONATE \u2192 --- | --- | | | Let's get this done.

We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day.

The family down the road maynot think, pray, or love like you, but they are your neighbors and you lookout for them. Now we know that Donald Trump, JD Vance, and MAGA Republicanshave a different vision of America. When they talk about freedom they mean thegovernment should have the freedom to invade every corner of our life. Take itfrom a small-town guy: they know nothing about what working people need.That's not what we do in Minnesota. We don\u2019t attack our neighbors\u2019 rights. Wewelcome everyone in, and we lift each other up. My friend Tina Smithunderstands this. And she works hard every day to ensure Minnesotans\u2019 voicesare heard in the United States Senate. That\u2019s what this campaign is about:working together to build a future where everyone has the opportunity not justto get by, but to get ahead. Where workers come first, health care and housingare human rights, and the government stays the hell out of your bedroom. Butwe need you in this fight with us.

Yesterday evening, my finance director called me up for an emergency meeting \u2014 and yes, the news really was *that bad*: We fell short of our $10 MILLION end-of-October goal. The only way we change that is by raising $894,208 over the next two days \u2014 and since voters head to the polls in just four days, closing that gap is non-negotiable. Will you please split $10 or more now between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's to ensure I have the resources to flip Florida blue? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5613-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 With the Democrats' razor-thin Senate majority at stake, NBC News and The Washington Post both confirm that all eyes really are on my race to flip Florida blue. And thanks to your support so far, I've steadily chipped away at Rick Scott's dwindling lead, to the point where polls show this race is statistically TIED. But Rick Scott and his corporate special interests have realized they can no longer take this race for granted. Now that they're scared, they're outspending us nearly 3-to-1 on MASSIVE ad buys attacking me across the Florida airwaves. So we have to fight back against this sudden swell of pro-Scott spending and ensure our people-powered message reaches as many voters as possible in this final stretch to Election Day. Rick Scott can tap his massive personal fortune to pull out all the stops in Florida's insanely expensive media market. But unlike him, I'm running a people-powered campaign \u2014 and according to my finance director, we won't have the funds to fight back without a SURGE of grassroots support tonight to make up the projected shortfall. Now more than ever, friend, I need your help: Will you please split $10, $25, or anything you can spare right now between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's? I can't get back on track to retire Rick Scott and keep the Senate majority blue without you. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5613-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 I'm so grateful I can count on supporters like you \u2014 thank you.

The Bolick Brigade has put in the time and we know ourhard work is paying off because our targeted voters are returning their earlymail-in ballots. We have been stopping by voter's houses, making phone callsand texting them to return their ballots. In the process, we have beenreminding early voters to take their mail-in ballots to the closest openvoting center or to simply vote in-person between now and Election Day becausethe deadline has passed ensuring timely delivery of early ballot back to thecounty in time to be processed. If you still have an early mail-in ballot youwould like to return, you can still drop it off at an open voting center orplace it inside the nearest drop box. Today, is the last official day of earlyvoting. Under state law, if you need to cast a ballot after today and beforeElection Day, the county has designated a few emergency voting locations(https://elections.maricopa.gov/voting/where-to-vote.html?mc_cid=9193bbd4cb&mc;_eid=UNIQID) on November 2nd and 4th betweenthe hours of 9am and 5pm.

If you vote in-person youshould have received a lengthy sample ballot last week. I received my sampleballot last Wednesday in the mail and then I voted early in-person at ASU-Westthe following day. I tracked my ballot. It took two days for Maricopa Countyto receive my ballot and earlier this morning my signature was finallyverified and my ballot was counted. In Maricopa County, the tabulation centeris understaffed by several hundred during early voting according to a localnews report. Maricopa County's ballot processing is working in 24-hour shiftsto get everything tabulated, working around the clock 24/7 due to heavyturnout.

He found a piece of grassy land, tooka look at it, and said, \u201cThis is the place.\u201d And that\u2019s where the farm began.He farmed the land until the early 1940s, and then passed it down to my folks.In 1978, my wife Sharla and I took over the farm and we\u2019re still here today,three generations and more than 40 years later. We\u2019ve made a lot of progresshere \u2014 Sharla and I built a new home, several steel buildings, and morestorage. The truth is, I love this work. Yes, it makes for early mornings andlate nights during planting and harvest seasons \u2014 but it also keeps megrounded, and it gives me perspective on the issues we face every day. When Ithink about climate change, I\u2019m thinking of folks on farms like mine,struggling with catastrophic droughts or historic levels of flooding. When Ithink about reforming the USPS, I\u2019m thinking of the people in ruralcommunities across Montana who rely on timely mail delivery for theirmedication or Social Security checks. And when I think about infrastructure,I\u2019m thinking of the rural towns near mine that need access to affordable,high-speed internet. These aren\u2019t abstract issues or talking points. They\u2019revery real challenges that deserve real solutions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m fightingfor in Washington. I spend every single day trying to do right by workingfamilies, farmers, students, and veterans here in Montana and across thecountry. I\u2019m running for reelection because there\u2019s still work to be done.Just like my parents and grandparents on the family farm, when I commit tosomething, I see it through. Can you make a split donation of any amount todaybetween my campaign and Voter Protection Project to help me keep up the fightin Washington?(https://act.protectvoting.org/go/83568?t=1003&akid;=17874%2E878179%2ERFLm4a)I\u2019ll leave you with one last truth about farming: Some years you get the rightamount of rain, and things work out really well. Other years, you get a wholelot less. That means it\u2019s important to be prepared for any outcome, and tohave a support system by your side when things get difficult. We don\u2019t knowwhat this campaign will look like, or what Republicans will throw our way overthese final few months. But with your support, we\u2019ll be ready. I appreciateanything you\u2019re able to pitch in.

Peter, I\u2019ve been crisscrossing the countryto do everything I can to help the team get across the finish line this fall.One of my most important stops: campaigning in Ohio with Bernie Moreno.President Trump and a Senate Republican majority will end the disastrousBiden-Harris agenda, but we cannot win a Senate majority without winning inOhio. Will you join me in supporting political outsider, Bernie Moreno?Bernie Moreno is the type of Senator we need in Washington. He\u2019s lived theAmerican dream - and wants to make sure our grandkids have the sameopportunities he had when he came to America at the age of five. He hasn\u2019tmade a career as a Washington insider - just the opposite. He\u2019s anentrepreneur who built a successful business from the ground up. ThisNovember, we\u2019ve got a great map\u2014unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in a fewdecades\u2014and with high-quality candidates like Bernie, I know we can win backthe Republican majority in the Senate. But here\u2019s the bad news, Peter.Democrats like Sherrod Brown are outraising us by millions. I\u2019ve alreadytransferred $4 million to help folks like Bernie, but he needs folks like youto step up to take on a 50-year career politician in Sherrod Brown. Even just$10 can make a difference when it comes to the millions Sherrod Brown israising from every liberal in the country. We have got to change the courseof this country and put an end to the dangerous Harris-Schumer-Brownagenda\u2014and that begins with doing everything we can to help Bernie Moreno winin Ohio and elect a Republican majority in the Senate! Thanks, John ThuneSenate Minority Whip Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fights for theAmerican Dream because he\u2019s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota, Colombia. Atage five, his American Dream began when he moved to the United States with hisfamily. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Through his relentlesswork ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned the first cardealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largest dealership groupsin America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value and transformationalpotential of blockchain technology, before it received mainstream attention,and moved much of his volunteer time and investment dollars into the space. In2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to be quite successful as Bernieserved as Chairman of the Board. After a long, successful career, Bernie soldmost of his business to begin focusing on his calling: protecting the Americandream for another generation. Solving our country\u2019s problems requires commonsense. In Washington, Bernie will fight to shrink government, protect ourfreedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party from taking our data and land, andalways put America First. Ohioans are done with politicians who talk a biggame and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. to get work done \u2013 just likehe always has.

Just four days to determine the next four years. **We can turn the page on the chaos and division of Donald Trump -- but not without your help reaching every last voter and getting them to the polls.** So I am kindly asking folks like you to chip in for the first time today. Will you make a $47 contribution to elect Kamala and Tim and defeat Trump? It wasn\u2019t that many weeks ago when Tim got a call -- _the call_ \\-- from Vice President Harris asking him to join this ticket. Ever since then, it\u2019s been a whirlwind. I have traveled across the country meeting all different kinds of voters: proud Democrats who vote frequently, folks who are still deciding, folks who don\u2019t vote in every election -- and yes, Republicans. **Everywhere I go, people are fed up with Donald Trump and fired up for Kamala and Tim\u2019s new way forward.** But I won\u2019t mince words, Peter. We remain the underdogs in this race. Nothing less than our very democracy is at stake. And we must win. In an election as close as this one, grassroots supporters like you will make the difference. With time running out, please give your first $47 to power our critical voter outreach efforts in these final days. _If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:_ | | $47 >> --- | $75 >> --- | $100 >> --- | $250 >> --- | $500 >> --- | Other >> ---  Thank you.

But today, I\u2019m just reachingout as a mom and a Tennessean who wants to see real change happen in ourstate. That\u2019s why I am all in for Gloria Johnson. Gloria is exactly the leaderTennessee deserves, but she needs all the support we can give. Will you joinme and chip in a few dollars to power her campaign in these final days?[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gj_em_bax] So, let\u2019s talk about why thiselection matters \u2014 in plain, simple terms. Gun violence is something no familyshould ever have to fear, yet it\u2019s a reality we face every day. If you\u2019re likeme, you\u2019re done with the routine of \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d without action andwant leaders who will actually do something tangible to make our communitiessafer. Gloria Johnson is exactly the leader we need in the U.S. Senate toachieve real solutions. Not many politicians know what it\u2019s like to be insidea school when the theoretical threat of gun violence becomes reality. Gloriadoes . She spent decades as a public school educator, and she confronted thatthreat firsthand. Gloria is not afraid to stand up and demand policies thatwill protect our kids, our schools, and our communities. But she\u2019s up againstMarsha Blackburn, a senator who\u2019s consistently sided with special interestsand blocked common-sense gun safety measures. With only four days untilElection Day, Gloria\u2019s team is working around the clock on their GOTV effortsto reach every last voter. They\u2019re calling, texting, and getting the word outacross Tennessee \u2014 but they need our help to keep it going strong and win thisrace. So, I\u2019m asking \u2014 will you chip in a few dollars of any amount today topower this final push? Every bit of support helps them mobilize Tennesseansand brings us all closer to real change.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gj_em_bax] If you\u2019ve saved your paymentinformation with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:DONATE $5[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gj_em_bax?express_lane=true&amount;=5]DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gj_em_bax?express_lane=true&amount;=10]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gj_em_bax?express_lane=true&amount;=25]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gj_em_bax?express_lane=true&amount;=100]DONATE $250[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gj_em_bax?express_lane=true&amount;=250]OTHER AMOUNT [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gj_em_bax] Thank you! -Melissa Joan Hart -------------------------- Gloria Johnson is running for theU.S. Senate because Tennesseans deserve leaders who care.

I can\u2019t sugarcoat it: this is the worst case scenario for Democrats. Everything from abortion rights to protecting our democracy is on the line in this race. But Republicans have the upper hand in Nevada \u2013 and they are on the path to flipping our state red, taking back Senate control, and electing Donald Trump.

        "body": "Derek, I\u2019ve had the honor of being Tim Kaine\u2019s friend since we met at HarvardLaw School in 1980. For over 40 years, I\u2019ve watched him wholeheartedly serveVirginia, first as mayor of Richmond, then as my Lieutenant Governor, andlater Governor, before serving together in the United States Senate. Thismeans I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with Tim and gathered plenty of intel on him.So as I sat down to write this email asking you to support Senator Kaine\u2019s re-election campaign, I found myself wondering exactly what I should say to youto assure you that Tim is the right choice to represent Virginia in Congress.And then it dawned on me: I want to tell you the top 3 things that annoy methe most about Tim Kaine. First off, Tim is way too nice! As a former civilrights attorney and missionary, he\u2019s spent his entire career committed tosocial justice, being driven by the value of kindness and the belief that itcan change peoples\u2019 lives. And he\u2019s a genuinely good guy on top of that.Second, he\u2019s ridiculously good at playing the harmonica. Seriously, he carriesthem in his briefcase, just in case a jam session breaks out on the Senatefloor. Third and finally, and I\u2019ve said this before, he\u2019s a deeply optimisticperson. Sometimes I can be a glass half-empty kind of guy, but Tim\u2019s alwaysseems about \u2154 full. We need someone like Tim Kaine in the Senate. Tim\u2019s valueof kindness and decency is what drives his undying dedication to serving thepeople of Virginia. And in a Congress plagued by partisan division, Tim\u2019srelentless optimism keeps him from giving up in the crucial fights to protectvoting rights, safeguard a woman\u2019s right to choose, and more. Now theharmonica\u2026 that one might not always translate to his work as a Senator, it\u2019sjust really great to watch. The thing is, Tim\u2019s seat could very well determineif the GOP takes control on Tuesday. Republicans are working overtime to ousthim and take back control of the Senate. So I\u2019m asking you today if you cansplit a $5 donation between my campaign and Tim Kaine\u2019s so we can send him,his kindness, impressive harmonica playing, and optimism back to the Senate?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?amount=5&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1 Ifyou've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation willbe automatically split between Tim Kaine and Mark Warner: EXPRESS DONATE $5https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=5&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $10 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=10&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $25 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=25&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $50 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=50&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1EXPRESS DONATE $100 https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane=true&amount;=100&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1DONATE OTHER https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw-email-240528-kaine?express_lane_other=true&refcode;=MW_ATA_EM_FR_Kainesplit_241101_T1_1I know Tim very well, and I know he\u2019s not done building a Virginia that worksfor all.

And if we don\u2019t raise what we neednow, we will be forced to give up the airwaves and let Adam Schiff and theDemocrat-machine backing him up run their attacks on me unopposed.

We do. But I don\u2019t believe in a \u2018fearonly\u2019 approach. I\u2019ll tell you what I believe: I believe in a bare minimum. $15minimum wage needed to be passed several years ago. I believe in guaranteed,improved, and expanded Medicare to every single American. We can\u2019t give up.I\u2019ve been in that place when I was a waitress.

Giving up is aprivilege that people just can\u2019t afford. Movements wax and wane. And there aretimes when it feels like our power is waning, and it\u2019s really easy to take ourball and go home.

I just made atough decision that you need to hear about immediately. According to severalrecent reports, Tim Sheehy lied about his military service. 1. On the campaigntrail, Sheehy claimed he had a gunshot wound in his arm from combat. Butaccording to the New York Times , public records, and firsthandaccounts\u2014including a Navy SEAL who served with Sheehy\u2014his gunshot wound wasfrom accidentally shooting himself in the arm in Glacier National Park. 2.Days later, NBC News released another bombshell report stating Sheehy liedabout being \u201cmedically discharged\u201d from the Navy. It\u2019s shocking\u2014and Montanansmust know the truth but we\u2019re running out of time. So I made the difficultdecision to launch more television and digital ads today. The money isn\u2019t inthe budget yet\u2014but with polls in the margin of error, running these final adscould be enough to break the tie in Jon\u2019s favor and win this race.

HouseSpeaker Mike Johnson's comments this week are a prime example of why Democratsneed control of the House. This week, during a GOP campaign event, SpeakerJohnson indicated that if Republicans gain control of the presidency in 2024,they will pursue \"massive reform\" to the ACA as part of a \"very aggressive\"first 100-day agenda. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been a lifeline forWashingtonians, improving health outcomes, offering financial security, andenabling equitable access to health care across diverse communities in thestate. Make no mistake: the Chaos Caucus still wants to undermine criticalhealth care programs and unwind health insurance regulations and safeguardsdespite the overwhelming support for the program. ACA enrollment has hit ahistoric level, with 21.3 million people opting for ACA marketplace coverageduring the Open Enrollment Period. This statistic includes more than fivemillion people \u2014 about a fourth \u2014 who are new to the ACA Marketplace and 16million people who renewed their existing ACA coverage. With enrollmentreaching a record high and millions of American families relying on the ACAfor coverage, it simply does not make sense that the Chaos Caucus' agenda isto repeal this landmark legislation. Rolling back the ACA would not just ripaway critical care from the 21.3 million folks using Marketplace plans \u2014 but45 million Americans could lose their health insurance provided through otherprovisions of the ACA . Think young adults afforded the option to stay ontheir parents' plans until age 26, people suffering from pre-existingconditions that could legally be denied care, and more. We cannot let thishappen to the millions of people relying on the ACA. We must take back theHouse next week. Our final weekend Get-Out-The-Vote canvassing efforts starttomorrow.

Time and again, myRepublican colleagues in the House propose a budget that would destroy thislife-saving legislation. We will not let that stand.I believe health care is aright. As always, we are going to fight back for Washingtonians and themillions of Americans who benefit from the provisions of the ACA. That is whyI voted to reduce premiums for ACA members and am actively working to expandaccess to high-quality, affordable health care that fits Northwest Washingtonfamilies' budgets. That is why I am continuing to work to lower the costs ofprescription drugs. I voted to reduce prescription drug costs by lettingMedicare negotiate drug prices, by imposing a tax penalty if drug companiesincrease their prices faster than inflation, and by capping the price ofinsulin at $35 per month. Millions of Americans are counting on us. This isthe type of policy-making that has a tangible impact on Northwest Washington,and we must protect the ACA in Congress. Your support now means I can continuethis important work in 2025.

Allred voted AGAINST denouncing theBiden Administration\u2019s immigration policies. Allred voted AGAINST condemningthe Biden border crisis and the tremendous burdens law enforcement officersface as a result. Allred voted AGAINST the POLICE Act, which would immediatelydeport any illegal alien who assaults a law enforcement officer.

These candidatesneed our help: Andrea Salinas is running for re-election in Oregon\u2019s 6thCongressional District.

In the state senate, Kristen helped pass ambitious clean energylegislation to address the climate crisis, create clean jobs, and saveMichiganders money.

As a state senator, Dave chaired theNatural Resources and Water Committee and introduced legislation to terminateoffshore oil and gas leases and secured funding to improve beaches.

[https://secure.ngpvan.com/uB3EyayArUyKTBgRW_x--A2] Hello, After fivebrand-new polls showed me LEADING my opponent Republican Deb Fischer here inNebraska\u2019s Senate race, Fischer\u2019s campaign and Mitch McConnell's Super PACsbought over $13.1 MILLION in TV ads attacking me. Fischer and McConnell havebegun absolutely blanketing the state with TV ads, attacking me withridiculous lies. We have an opportunity to win Nebraska\u2019s Senate seat \u2013 butonly if we can counter the lies and match them on the air. That\u2019s why I justmade a very difficult decision and told my campaign we could begin airing moreof our own ads to fight back, even though we don\u2019t technically have all themoney in our budget to do so just yet. We\u2019re taking this risk because we haveto. Nebraska is now the closest Senate race in the entire country according toresearchers at Princeton University. So I made an executive decision and tooka bet that grassroots donors like you would come through and help us fill our$100,000 budget gap\u2026 We need to do everything we can if we\u2019re going to winthis Senate seat and elect a blue-collar worker to be the 51st vote in theU.S. Senate. That means taking a few risks.

The comfort in that knock was knowing that while danger was allaround you, the person on the other side of the door was friendly \u2014 someoneyou could depend on. I\u2019ve never been afraid to ask for help when I needed it.And right now, I\u2019m knocking. I\u2019m coming to you for help. Kari Lake is on theoffense. With just a few days until voting ends, she has a resource advantageover us. She\u2019s got more money to spend, and she is funneling all of it into amassive surge. She\u2019s outspending us on television in one of the most importantregions of the state. But I refuse to let her win.

Maybe it will even motivate you to make your very first online donationbefore tonight's fundraising deadline to ensure I can defeat Rick Scott!https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2476-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 First and foremost, I'm everything I am todaybecause of my mother. She brought my sisters and me to America when I was just14. Mom knew we had to get out of Ecuador, which was transitioning todemocracy after suffering under a military dictatorship. She knew America wasthe key to a better life. Well, with a whole lot of hard work (includingworking in a doughnut shop to help my family get by), long hours, and a ton ofhope, we were able to win our American dream. My story is what inspires me togive back to this incredible country and state that gave me so much. Afterputting myself through college, I worked for several nonprofit organizationsacross Florida, helping to protect our wildlife and preserve our coral reefs.Rick Scott, on the other hand, banned saying the words \"climate change\" whenhe was governor of Florida, and the League of Conservation Voters gave him awhopping 0% score last year. During my time working at Florida InternationalUniversity, I spearheaded a new program to expand affordable health careaccess to more Floridians. But Rick Scott has voted to repeal the AffordableCare Act more times than I care to count. And who can forget he committed oneof the largest Medicare frauds in the history of our country. Eventually, Ihad the honor of serving my community in the U.S. House of Representatives,where I became the first South American immigrant to be elected to Congress!In the House, I wrote the bill to expand seniors\u2019 Medicare Advantage coverage,worked with Republicans to provide economic relief to families and smallbusinesses, and secured $200 million for Everglades restoration. I'm proud ofmy record \u2014 but can Rick Scott say the same, friend? He has used his time inoffice writing the plan to end Social Security and Medicare, attempting toundermine our elections, attacking our rights, and making it harder forworking families to get ahead. As a result, Rick Scott's approval ratings withFloridians are underwater. Even a large percentage of Republicans don'tapprove of him! Now, polling shows me statistically tied with Scott, and injust 4 days, we can defeat him and protect our Democratic Senate majority inthe process. But with Rick Scott outspending me 3-1 on the airwaves, it'sgoing to take a surge in grassroots support from people like you to trulydefeat him. So please, rush a donation of $5 or whatever you can to send me tothe U.S. Senate and give Floridians the true leader and public servant wedeserve!https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2476-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 -------- This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.

If so, thank you, and please sign up for a GOTV shift athttps://www.mobilize.us/2024mnvictory/! You don\u2019t need to read this email anyfurther. But I am aware some of you may be considering sitting this electionout, or voting for a third-party candidate, because you strongly disagree withKamala Harris about Gaza. This email is for you. Please read on. We have manythings in common. Like you, I am outraged by the suffering in Gaza: themassive and indiscriminate loss of life, the displacement of millions ofpeople, the deliberate destruction of hospitals, the use of food as a weapon,all of it. Every nation, including Israel, has the right to defend itself, andall hostages must be released now. But no nation, including Israel, has theright to collectively punish another people, including the people of Gaza. Butthat is what has happened, and like you, I believe American policy has notdone enough to stop it. Now to Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris has said she\u2019s fora cease fire. She\u2019s said she\u2019s for more humanitarian relief now. She standsfor international human-rights laws, and she has the active support of membersof Congress who are insisting on the enforcement of international human-rightslaw. And she has publicly called out Rudy Giuliani\u2019s violent rhetoric aboutPalestinian children at Trump\u2019s racist Madison Square Garden rally. And as shesaid in her speech in Washington on Tuesday night, she will listen toeveryone, including people who disagree with her. I\u2019ve known her for years, soI know from personal experience that this is true. On the other hand, DonaldTrump, who put in place the illegal Muslim ban as president, has said he\u2019lllet Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cfinish the job.\u201d Donald Trump, whose own chief ofstaff says he is a fascist, has promised to deploy the military againstconstitutional protest and be a dictator on Day One. So if you care about thepeople of Gaza \u2014 and the right to protest about Gaza \u2014 you don\u2019t want DonaldTrump in power. Now I doubt any of you reading this email plan to vote forDonald Trump. But \u2014 and this is critical \u2014 if you sit this election out, or ifyou vote for a third-party candidate who will not win, you are letting DonaldTrump get one vote closer to power. Donald Trump in power will increasesuffering in Gaza and the world. If Kamala Harris is elected, we will havesomeone in the White House who will use the powers of the presidency toalleviate suffering at home and abroad, not increase it. Just as importantly,we will have someone in the White House with whom we can be in dialogue, notsomeone who will turn our country against us. Don\u2019t take only it from me.Senator Bernie Sanders supports Kamala Harris even though he stronglydisagrees with current Gaza policy, because he believes that Kamala in theWhite House is the best chance to change that policy. Hear more:https://x.com/berniesanders/status/1851040553745432775?s=42 Georgia State Rep.Ruwa Romman supports Kamala Harris for the same reason. Hear more:https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/ruwa-romman-harris-dnc-gaza-uncommitted-vote-1235144105/ Nada Elmikashfi of Wisconsin, a SudaneseAmerican and Muslim activist and political organizer who supports the peopleof Gaza, supports Kamala Harris because she believes that supporting Harris \u2014and not a third-party candidate \u2014 is the only way to keep Trump from makingeverything she cares about worse and harming far more communities than herown. Hear more: https://x.com/nadaelmikashfi/status/1851465420097585482?s=10And former President Jimmy Carter, who brokered the Camp David accords and hasworked tirelessly for more than 40 years for a comprehensive peace in theMiddle East that includes dignity, opportunity, and self-determination forPalestinians, supports Kamala Harris. I strongly encourage you to listen tothem. And finally, even as Gaza is first in many of our thoughts, even more isat stake in this election. Racial justice, abortion rights, climate change,and economic fairness: it\u2019s all on the ballot, along with the very soul ofthis country. Trump\u2019s racist Madison Square Garden rally leaves no more roomfor doubt about that. For the sake of all the people that would bear the bruntof Donald Trump\u2019s deliberate cruelty, and for the best chance of building abetter future for the people of Gaza, the Middle East, the United States, andthe world, I am asking you not to sit this out: I am asking for your vote forKamala Harris for President and Tim Walz for Vice President. - Keith Preparedand paid for by the Keith Ellison for Attorney General committee, PO Box17224, Minneapolis, MN 55417 Keith Ellison for Attorney General PO Box 17224Minneapolis, MN 55417 United States If you believe you received this messagein error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please unsubscribe:https://secure.ngpvan.com/p/rnmAh_BZp0CUaBw6XYl7Xw2?unsubscribedata=2W3VAJdw0Km2QlWjWSNn5jILNXUrlnEvliKA4k45I5pVyuqoBa4Y3UFm3BhbuqHtqqYrTIxbuJjziosllmOXfejlaoFG7D3AFDxJQG93VgilTx6DNsKdZMq%2FC2O3PQ%2F7BSpw91OasYmadv2hVJ%2F4elgiqlhVrEn8xl2lKfAyhd87jzDY6fFGwvfYWo7%2BOwui6dGaOsBEWAoyDu%2BaV7KBvNKX8hASP2M4qjbsfyGIzPQ7TxfTZTFaQgp3IYTwE9WBLAlxcSLEA5OK5pJjTWRqM6PnUTx%2B%2BQtqhSH6S%2B5v6nmHFpYEVkzLQ0tDTItkioUCjKTmQHt%2Bg9VoP1RJTtAVnAuUK8ObOKuEtRLoGf9z8Vv%2B9lwyIdQN0jkW8gZoR6D0H3taZ70cUxj55pabsOMrgUZPOCStGYjYt%2B55QwokiuMqRzJHxx8BVU5cxIFJ4Thh.",

Peter, I\u2019ve been crisscrossing the countryto do everything I can to help the team get across the finish line this fall.One of my most important stops: campaigning in Ohio with Bernie Moreno.President Trump and a Senate Republican majority will end the disastrousBiden-Harris agenda, but we cannot win a Senate majority without winning inOhio. Will you join me in supporting political outsider, Bernie Moreno?Bernie Moreno is the type of Senator we need in Washington. He\u2019s lived theAmerican dream - and wants to make sure our grandkids have the sameopportunities he had when he came to America at the age of five. He hasn\u2019tmade a career as a Washington insider - just the opposite. He\u2019s anentrepreneur who built a successful business from the ground up. ThisNovember, we\u2019ve got a great map\u2014unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in a fewdecades\u2014and with high-quality candidates like Bernie, I know we can win backthe Republican majority in the Senate. But here\u2019s the bad news, Peter.Democrats like Sherrod Brown are outraising us by millions. I\u2019ve alreadytransferred $4 million to help folks like Bernie, but he needs folks like youto step up to take on a 50-year career politician in Sherrod Brown. Even just$10 can make a difference when it comes to the millions Sherrod Brown israising from every liberal in the country. We have got to change the courseof this country and put an end to the dangerous Harris-Schumer-Brownagenda\u2014and that begins with doing everything we can to help Bernie Moreno winin Ohio and elect a Republican majority in the Senate! Thanks, John ThuneSenate Minority Whip Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fights for theAmerican Dream because he\u2019s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota, Colombia. Atage five, his American Dream began when he moved to the United States with hisfamily. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Through his relentlesswork ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned the first cardealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largest dealership groupsin America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value and transformationalpotential of blockchain technology, before it received mainstream attention,and moved much of his volunteer time and investment dollars into the space. In2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to be quite successful as Bernieserved as Chairman of the Board. After a long, successful career, Bernie soldmost of his business to begin focusing on his calling: protecting the Americandream for another generation. Solving our country\u2019s problems requires commonsense. In Washington, Bernie will fight to shrink government, protect ourfreedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party from taking our data and land, andalways put America First. Ohioans are done with politicians who talk a biggame and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. to get work done \u2013 just likehe always has.

It was a hate-fest of disgusting rhetoric aboutimmigrants, Puerto Ricans, Black Americans, Jews, Muslims, and anyone the MAGAmovement deems their enemy. It also wasn't lost on me that House Speaker MikeJohnson attended and gave a speech, after which Trump later thanked him andominously declared: \"our little secret is having a big impact, he and I have alittle secret, we will tell you what it is when the race is over.\" Whetherthat means Johnson is ready to legislatively implement Project 2025, orwhether he's planning to have the House deny a free and fair election, I can'tsay. But I can say that Mike Johnson giving his seal of approval to adisgusting rally and him being praised by Donald Trump as cooking up a secretplan with him shows that we cannot afford to have him as Speaker again comeJanuary. With only 4 days left, the state of play for control of the Houseremains as close as ever \u2014 and flipping the 5th District here in Oregon fromred to blue remains one of the biggest steps we can take toward gaining aDemocratic House majority. Polls have OR-05 a statistical dead heat, andRepublicans are launching one desperate attack after another to try and stopJanelle Bynum.

He's everywhere Donald Trump goes. He infamously skipped animportant Senate vote to be Trump's lapdog in the courtroom for one of Trump'scriminal trials.Pathetic. Anyway, Donald Trump gave Rick Scott a very ...interesting shoutout: It's interesting how often Trump resorts to callingother people liars \u2014 when he himself is perhaps the most notorious serial liarin modern American history. It's no wonder he and Rick Scott get along sowell. Scott has lied time and again about his record of writing the plan toend Medicare and Social Security, about supporting a national abortion ban,and even about his Medicare fraud. Lies, lies, and more lies from the snakethat is Rick Scott and his buddy, the twice-impeached, disgraced liar of aformer president, Donald Trump. The TRUTH of the matter is that Donald Trumpand Rick Scott are scared of my new ad. They are scared because they know I'mstatistically tied with Scott in the polls as Floridians are beginning to casttheir ballots. They are scared we will pull off a massive political upset byflipping Florida blue.Well, Peter, they are right to be scared. We can winthis race and protect Democratic Senate control in the process, but it simplyis not possible if I don't hit my $10 million fundraising goal to fight RickScott's attack ads and reach every Florida voter.
