In 2022, Adam Frischnearly defeated Lauren Boebert. He lost by just 546 votes. That scared LaurenBoebert so much that she came running to my district. But the voters ofeastern Colorado don\u2019t want a carpetbagging extremist more concerned withgetting on Fox News than the needs of her constituents. Even Republicans aredone with Boebert: 57% voted for someone else in the primary! We can finallykick Lauren Boebert out of Congress in November, but the only way I\u2019ll be ableto win is if we hit every fundraising goal and have the resources to fullyfund my campaign. We\u2019ve set a goal of raising another $250,000 before ourfinal end-of-month fundraising deadline, but right now, we\u2019re still incrediblyshort. So I have to ask: Please, if you can afford to, will you make adonation to my campaign \u2013 every dollar you can spare \u2013 to help me defeatLauren Boebert?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Every dollar you give today will bring us one step closer to finally sendingLauren Boebert packing, and truly no amount you can afford is too small.

All of thesecandidates can win if they have the funds to get their message out. \u25baBusinessman Eric Hovde is running neck-and-neck with incumbent Senator TammyBaldwin in Wisconsin. One poll conducted by the Trafalgar Group even showedHovdeleading by one point. Democrats have pulled their fire alarm and arepouring money into the state to save Baldwin. \u25ba Businessman Bernie Moreno ison the verge of defeating incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown in Ohio, who hasbeen a politician for over fifty years. Rasmussen Reports has Moreno up by onepoint, while theWashington Post has his down by one point. This is the bestchance we've had to defeat Brown in years. \u25ba Senator Ted Cruz is theDemocrats' #1 target this year, and they are dumping millions of dollars intoTexas to turn Texas Blue. His opponent, Rep. Colin Allred, is a Kamala Harrisliberal who is desperately trying to hide his record. The Hill/Emerson Collegepoll showed Cruz leading by only one point. \u25ba Conservative former TV newsanchor Kari Lake is surging in Arizona and only trails liberal Ruben Gallegoby four points. But apparently, she's too conservative for Mitch McConnell,who refuses to spend the party's money to support her. There's still time forher to win in a state where President Trump is expanding his lead. \u25ba Armycombat veteran Sam Brown is rapidly gaining on incumbent Senator Jacky Rosenin Nevada. Republicans are doing exceptionally well with early voting, andBrown only trails by three points, according to the latest Rasmussen Reportspoll.

That\u2019s why I am so excited about Trisha\u2019s campaign: **New polling shows that Trisha can win and defeat Lauren Boebert! But Trisha can only flip this seat blue if she is able to raise enough money and fully fund her campaign.** I\u2019m ready to help Trisha Calvarese take on Lauren Boebert and finally kick her out of Congress, and I am asking you to join me today: **Please, will you make a donation right now to Trisha Calvarese\u2019s campaign to help her defeat Lauren Boebert this November?

        "body": "Peter, Friday November 1st marks the 3rd day of early voting here in Oklahoma.So what are the three things you need to know? First of all, there just sohappen to be 3 judges of the Oklahoma Supreme Court on the ballot. And theyare ALL liberal. They are all THREE appointed by Democrat Governors. And wehave the chance to remove all three at once. If WE vote NO on all threeliberal Supreme Court judges, they will be removed and can no longer be ableto force their liberal agenda on Oklahoma. The question on your ballot will beif Edmonson, Gurich, & Kauger should be retained in their current positions.And the answer is NO, they should not be retained. All three must go, so wemust all VOTE NO! Secondly, you\u2019ll be voting on several candidates beyond justthe President. We can all compare the economic boom with 4 years of PresidentTrump to the disastrous 4 years under Biden-Harris. If your mind isn\u2019t alreadymade up on who to vote for as President think of how much better off you were4 years ago & realize we can have that again. There are other candidates onthe ballot, so the easiest way to vote is to choose \u201cRepublican\u201d straightparty voting. That\u2019ll make your selection for all those races & help put inRepublicans at the State & local level to help restore our economy & keep moremoney in your pockets. And third, you\u2019ll also have two State Questions on yourballot. SQ833 creates new tax structures. Many people are torn on how to votefor this, but we\u2019ll just put out there that we don\u2019t believe the governmentneeds MORE ways to tax us. If you agree we don\u2019t need more tax options, you\u2019llvote no on this one. As for SQ834 it would clarify that ONLY citizens can votein Oklahoma elections. It\u2019s obvious part of the Biden-Harris open border planis to get more people voting, including non-citizens. In fact a dozen citiesalready allow non-citizens to vote INCLUDING Washington DC! We must secure ourelections by allowing ONLY citizens to vote. Otherwise liberal court judges(refer to the first item listed above!) will allow law-breaking foreigners tovote in our elections. So there you have it, the three things you need toknow. 1) Vote no on all THREE Supreme Court judges. 2) Vote Republicanstraight party. 3) On the State Questions vote for lower taxes & ONLY citizensvoting. -Team OKGOP -=-=- Paid for by OKGOP and not authorized by anycandidate or candidate's committee. www.OKGOP.com - (405) 528-3501. 4031 N.Linconln Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK 73105 This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.

Wade a \u201csuccess\u201d. * He voted against expanding Title X funding, whichprovides essential reproductive healthcare like ultrasounds and affordablecontraception. * He voted against lowering insurance premiums and prescriptioncosts, capping the price of life-saving medication, and cutting hospital fees.* In Congress, he would have the power to enact this dangerous agenda on anational level. In contrast, I\u2019m dedicated to building a future that protectsabortion rights, lowers costs for families, and provides affordable healthcarefor everyone.

Thank you, Nella Domenici Help Elect Nella and Secure the Border \u00bb ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

But first, I want to update you on everything that\u2019s been happening. We\u2019re only 5 days away from the election, and attacks from MAGA Republicans are non-stop \u2014 especially Donald Trump. Whenever Trump gets near a microphone, it\u2019s almost a given that he\u2019s going to attack me. At a MAGA rally in California, Trump threatened to withhold federal assistance for wildfires, attacked me personally, and urged his supporters to back GOP candidates across California. On Fox News, Trump rolled out a dangerous new attack, calling me the \u201cenemy within,\u201d claiming that I\u2019m even more dangerous than foreign adversaries. He even threatened to use the military against me for holding him accountable. His goal is simple, Derek: sabotage my campaign and silence anyone standing in his way. It\u2019s clear Trump and his allies still see me as a threat \u2014 and the closer we get to Election Day, the worse and more frequent the attacks will become. I don\u2019t take a dime from corporate PACs, so it will take a movement of grassroots supporters to overcome Trump and his allies\u2019 attacks.

First the New YorkTimes lied about my childhood and family, and now CNN is lying about mybusiness record. And what\u2019s worse, they are doing it all because I\u2019m withinstriking distance of an entrenched career politician, Bob Casey, in the #1swing state in the nation that will determine control of the U.S Senate. BobCasey is getting Leftist news sources to do his dirty work, and I WON\u2019TTOLERATE IT. Here's the truth: this is a long message and I hope you will readall the way to the end. I grew up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. We lived oncampus at Bloomsburg State College and my parents owned a farm ten minutesdown the road. I had summer jobs baling hay and trimming Christmas trees atnearby farms. My dad started his career teaching history, economics, &democracy at Punxsutawney High. My mom began teaching fourth through sixthgraders at a public school near Pittsburgh. I\u2019m incredibly proud that my dadwas chosen to be president of Bloomsburg State College (now BloomsburgUniversity) at only 34 years old. I\u2019m so proud of my parents\u2019 teachingcareers and to have been raised in Bloomsburg. It was there that I wrestledand played football and was nominated to the U.S. Military Academy at WestPoint. And it was there that I came home to a parade after serving in combatduring the Gulf War. After the Army, I earned a Ph.D. in internationalrelations before moving to Pittsburgh to start a career in business. I workedmy way up to become the CEO of FreeMarkets, a successful tech startup thatemployed hundreds in Western Pennsylvania. I was then called to serviceagain, this time in the highest levels of government as Under Secretary ofTreasury and as Deputy National Security Advisor. Following this, I joinedBridgewater Associates, one of the largest, most successful investment firmsin the world, which manages the pension plans of groups including teachers,firefighters and law enforcement. I have lived the American Dream, and I amrunning for Senate to bring my decades of experience and love for our countryto fix our broken economy that is a direct result of policies supported by myopponent, who has spent 18 years in Washington with NOTHING to show for it. Iknew getting into this race could mean things would get nasty, but it\u2019s sad tosee we\u2019ve fallen so far that these media outlets like the New York Times andCNN are pushing the Democrats\u2019 baked narrative about my upbringing and mybusiness record. I\u2019ve opened myself and my family up to attacks from theleft, and every day feels like a battle. But I\u2019m no stranger to fighting forwhat is right andif we don\u2019t elect leaders to go to DC to clean up the messthe career politicians made, we will lose America as we know it! Here\u2019s whereI need your help, Fellow Patriot. We need to combat these lies with the TRUTHabout me. The Democrats are seeing the same polls you and I see. They know ifKamala Harris and Bob Casey lose Pennsylvania, they lose it ALL, and they aregoing to do WHATEVER IT TAKES to try and defeat me. I hate asking for money \u2014I\u2019m not a career politician, and it\u2019s not in my nature \u2014 but I have no choicebut to ask if we\u2019re going to hit our fundraising goal for the final stretch ofthe campaign.Will you chip in $30 or more right now to fight back against thelies from the Left? Chuck Schumer and his allies are working overtime toobliterate my campaign. They have committed to spend whatever it takes todefeat me.They know if I win this race in Pennsylvania, it\u2019ll be IMPOSSIBLEfor Democrats to keep their majority in the Senate. If we don\u2019t show theDemocrats we can win this race, it\u2019s game over. That\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping you canspare$29, $50, or even $100 to help me fight back against the lies. DONATEYour donation will take us one step closer to victory, and I am so gratefulfor your support. Thank you, Dave McCormick P.S. Democrats from all over thecountry are pouring money into this race to defeat me because they know thisrace could flip the Senate red.Will you chip in $29 or more to make sure Ihave the resources to WIN?

Thank you, Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Ultimately, this election isabout two different visions for our nation. One focused on the future. And onefocused on the past. Jacky Rosen and I believe in a future where every personhas the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. Where no child hasto grow up in poverty. Where every worker has the freedom to join a union.Where every person has affordable health care, child care, and paid leave.Where every senior can retire with dignity. But Donald Trump and his extremistRepublican allies want to take our country backward. They intend to cut SocialSecurity and Medicare, to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporationsand to make working families foot the bill, and end the Affordable Care Act.America has tried these failed policies before. We are not going back.Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, the batonis in our hands. To protect the right to vote. To get assault weapons off ofour streets. To restore reproductive freedom, reversing Donald Trump's extremeabortion bans. Jacky Rosen is running for reelection to continue deliveringfor Nevadans. In the Senate, she has never hesitated to take on powerfulspecial interests to bring down costs for hardworking Nevada families.

Two of the most important congressional races in the nation are happening right here in our state. Next door to our district in AZ-01, Dr. Amish Shah has the chance to finally beat David Schweikert and flip a critical battleground seat blue. Schweikert is a MAGA die-hard who helped write the Trump tax cuts, which gave billionaires and big corporations a $1.9 trillion tax break. He's also an anti-choice fanatic who once said that women who have abortions \"hate our country.\" And in AZ-06, Kirsten Engel is running to flip a seat that went red by just 5,232 votes in 2022. Peter, winning these frontline races may be the difference between retaking the House and falling short. We need your help to elect Democrats up and down the ballot here in AZ. Can we count on you to split a contribution between our three races before midnight tonight, when we close the books on our final monthly fundraising deadline of this race?

Polls are currently flipping back and forth between me and myopponent. At this point, our race is a total tossup. Every dollar we raisehelps us reach more undecided voters, and in a race that will come down tojust a handful of votes, that makes all the difference. My millionaireopponent and his far-right allies are funneling MILLIONS into our districtbecause they know it\u2019ll determine who controls Congress. The only way we canfight back and make sure we get the last word with voters is with yoursupport. So I\u2019m personally asking, will you donate by midnight to ensure wehave the resources to win on Election Day?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kmr-email-october24?refcode=email_103124_halloween Happy Halloween \ud83c\udf83 !

Can I count onyou to step up with a split donation of $10 between my campaign and DefeatBoebert PAC today to ensure my team and I have the resources we need to pushback against the $40 million worth of attack ads Ted Cruz and his allies arerunning against us right now? RUSH MY DONATION Last time around, Ted Cruzwon his race by just over 2% of the vote \u2013 that was a difference of about215,000 votes, Peter. I remember how it felt watching the results roll in onNovember 6, 2018, and let me tell you, it was a nail-biter. I have no doubtsthat this year will be when we finally send Ted Cruz packing. But despitebeing closer than ever to defeating Ted, we've still got a lot more work to doand only a handful of days left to do it. I know seeing a number like $3million can feel overwhelming, but if thousands of hardworking folks like youchip in $5 here, $25 there, and the occasional $100, we will be able tocollectively reach this critical goal. So please, will you chip in a splitdonation between my campaign and Defeat Boebert PAC of $10 or whatever you canafford now so I can hit my final end-of-month goal and flip Texas blue?

With Election Dayaround the corner, right now is the most critical time to surge support forEMILYs List women up and down the ballot. Let me explain: Over the past month,I've been on the ground in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, and a few other keystates. I've talked to voters, candidates, and volunteers all across thecountry. And I can tell you firsthand that the polls and the pundits areright: our women's races will be close. There's a saying in politics, belovedby fundraisers and field organizers alike: the margin of effort. When thepolls are tight, and a race could go either way, what matters most is theheart, grit, and commitment of the supporters. If we put in the work, we'llwin. If we don't, we won't. It's that simple. Critical races like VP KamalaHarris', Sen. Tammy Baldwin's (WI-SEN), and Rep. Susan Wild's (PA-07) now fallsquarely within the margin of effort.

But this year, Kirsten is facing an incredibly tough fight at the ballot box. Democrats are defending a massive 23 seats, meaning our grassroots resources are spread incredibly thin. And in 2022, New York saw the biggest red wave across the country. Now, those same extremists are working overtime to defeat Kirsten and retake control of the Senate. There's no way Kirsten backs down from this fight. But I also know exactly what it's going to take to win this election and defend our razor-thin Senate majority: Strong grassroots investments from people like you. That's why I'm personally asking \u2014 can you make a donation before midnight tonight to help my friend Kirsten defend her must-win seat and protect our Senate majority? Trust me, this is the only way that Kirsten will win. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_fr_defend-senate-2024?refcode=jtk5593-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 In everything that she does \u2014 every fight that she takes on, every piece of legislation that she supports, and every constituent that she advocates for \u2014 Kirsten is absolutely relentless. That's what makes her such an incredible advocate for Americans around the country (and one of the most powerful allies that you can have here in the Senate). Now, more than ever, New Yorkers, Democrats, and all Americans need Kirsten's bold voice in Congress. Because today, our most fundamental rights are under unprecedented attack from extremist Republicans. We're in a national emergency for our democracy and all of the values we hold dear. Kirsten and I are fighting every day to safeguard these rights. We're working to pass voting rights legislation that will ensure every single American has equal, unrestricted access to the ballot box. And we're rallying support to certify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would give us a legal basis to restore reproductive rights nationwide. But to continue these fights, and save our Senate majority, Kirsten needs your help: The only way to defeat the GOP's megadonors is with strong grassroots support from folks like you. So please, friend, if you have anything to spare today, will you rush a donation now to help Kirsten protect her seat so that we can continue to fight for your family in the Senate? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_fr_defend-senate-2024?refcode=jtk5593-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for all that you do, Sen.

There's a strong chance it will all come down to Ohio, which meansSherrod is the ONLY thing standing between us and a Republican Senate. Friend,I've worked on campaigns for a long time. I've been on the winning side andthe losing side. If there's one thing I know, it's that money makes a BIGdifference. I wish it weren't the case, but it is. TV ads, phone banks, yardsigns, campaign events in every corner of the state \u2013 it all adds up FAST.That's why I'm so terrified right now. If this were a simple battle betweengood and evil, I wouldn't be worried \u2013 Sherrod is as good a leader as Ohioanshave ever had. He fights harder for workers than anybody I know, and he's notafraid to take on the big banks and corporations that are making things harderfor the middle class. But money muddies the waters, and his opponent has got aton of it. He's poured A TON into his own campaign, and there's a lot morewhere that came from. Sherrod simply doesn't have that kind of money \u2013 sothat's where this grassroots team needs to come in and have his back, friend.I know Sherrod can win this critical race and keep the Senate blue, but ONLYIF we all come together to give him the resources he needs. So I'm asking:Will you rush $5, $25, or even $50 to help him win in Ohio and defend ourSenate majority? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?amounts=250,100,50,25,5&refcode;=jtk3725-fr-text Thanks for doingyour part \u2013 there's simply no other option if we want to save the Senate! \u2013James Carville -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

Asthe chair of BOLD PAC, I\u2019m working with Democrats across the country to ensurewe elect progressives up and down the ballot. Your support has beeninstrumental in keeping our momentum heading strong into Election Day, but wecan\u2019t slow down now.

We\u2019re only 5 days away from Election Day, meaning themost crucial time to reach voters is NOW. So, I have to ask: Will you help mehit my October goal in a few hours so I can continue reaching voters acrossthe country in this final stretch?

As asitting senator from Georgia, I'll always put working families and smallbusinesses first, friend. And like me, Debbie knows that we need to do more tosupport hardworking Americans in the South and across the country. With hercommitment to reducing high costs and inflation, protecting Social Securityand Medicare, and restoring reproductive freedom, we need Debbie's voice inthe Senate representing Floridians. But I know the GOP machine is about to goall in on Florida. We need to build on the growing Democratic excitement andhelp Debbie reach her $10 million goal before her last end-of-month deadlinebefore the election. That way, she can pull ahead in the polls and win big inNovember.

Six days from rightnow, voters will decide the future of America. I'm looking at the early votetotals and I'll be completely upfront with you\u2026 I'm beyond worried. I'mpetrified. The Democrat voter turnout/ballot harvesting machine is chargingfull speed ahead to rob Donald Trump of the presidency, steal the House, andhold the line in the Senate. At this point, we could wake up on November 6thto a full Democrat takeover of America. That's why President Trump and I areworking hand in glove to save the country.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bI'm campaigning on stage with him. I'm traveling to swing states like Michiganto turn out voters. And I'm rallying Republican voters in Tennessee and beyondto win. The only problem is I'm about $80,000 short of my fundraising goalright now. I'm scared that if I don't make up the lost ground, I'll have toshut down our voter turnout operation for the final stretch of the election. Ididn't want to burden you with this but I'm out of options. I'm forced to cometo you - with my hat in hand - to plead with you for help. If you can spareeven a few dollars, it would mean a great deal to me.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bCONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT If you canhttps://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bpitch in $100 - $250, it would make a huge dent in my budget shortfall andchange everything.

If every Conservative gave at leastthis much, the Democrats would be out of power for a generation. All I ask isthat you donate something before Election Day. I'm afraid that if too manyfolks sit on the sidelines - and decide not to give - the Democrats will walkaway with this election. Do not let this happen.

These justices and their MAGA pals Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas have gutted the EPA, slashed voting rights, and overturned Roe v. Wade. This far-right majority doesn\u2019t represent the values of the majority of Americans, so it\u2019s past time we ensured the court wasn\u2019t a cesspool of MAGA extremists. That\u2019s why President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to enact term limits for justices is so critical. Instead of having a MAGA majority for decades, we could at regular intervals nominate justices who aren\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s hand-picked weirdos! This plan is incredible for democracy and reproductive rights, but it will need a groundswell of support if we are going to get it done. Will you sign our petition today demanding that Congress pass Joe Biden\u2019s Supreme Court term limits plan? We need every single local Democrat to sign if we are going to have enough momentum to save our country from this extreme Supreme Court!

Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Right now, with just hours left until our final end-of-monthdeadline of the campaign, we\u2019re just shy of hitting $30,000. Peter, I don\u2019tthink I need to emphasize just how critical TX-15 is. This is the SOLEcompetitive House race in the state of Texas, and what we do here will definethe road to the House majority on November 5. Not to mention I\u2019m up againstMonica De La Cruz, who is as MAGA extremist, anti-choice, anti-seniors, anti-workers, anti-Texas as they come. Now what\u2019s spookier than that? With exactly5 days left until the election, we can\u2019t afford a single misstep or risk. Wehave to win this thing, folks \u2014 the future of Texas and democracy at largedepends on it. And if we\u2019re going to make that happen, we need ALL theresources possible to supercharge our campaign.

And what if we told you that more Republicans have cast theirballots than Democrats so far in Arizona? Or that Donald Trump and VicePresident Harris are neck and neck in the polls right now \u2014 making everyperson, every conversation, and every vote absolutely essential to securing awin for VP Harris and sending Trump packing for good?

From the earliest days of thiselection cycle, you've been the driving force behind our efforts to grow theHouse Majority.  As Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, I've had theprivilege of traveling the country, working with our candidates, and seeingyour impact firsthand. Your generosity has allowed us to build a top-notchteam, craft cutting-edge campaigns, and fight the Democrat machine.  But I know that our success isn't just about House Republicans - **it's aboutthe countless hours you've volunteered, your thoughtful survey responses, andthe contributions you've given to fuel our movement. You're the unsung hero ofour party, and I'm honored to stand alongside you in this fight.**  Now, as we sprint to the finish line, I need your help one more time if youcan spare a few dollars.  **We're facing a fierce battle in the final days of this election, and everydollar counts. That's why I'm humbly asking you to make a final contributionto help defend our razor-thin House Majority.**  Your donation will go directly towards our Get Out the Vote efforts,advertising, and other key pieces of our campaign operation. It will help usdefend our vulnerable incumbents, _flip key seats, and elect a new generationof conservative leaders._  If you can swing it, one last contribution would mean the world to me, but ifnot, please don't stress, you've done so much for us already.

Ithought that would be the end of the damage\u2026 But with the election rightaround the corner, Kamala\u2019s Deep State truly wants to ruin me with all they\u2019vegot.

Over the last few days, we\u2019veheard ridiculous claims about President Trump being a \u201cfascist.\u201d Let me tellyou what fascism is\u2026 Fascism is weaponizing the legal system to punish yourpolitical opponents. Fascism is having your home taken from you. Fascism istaking the law license away from your opponent\u2019s lawyer. Fascism is trying toturn your enemies into political prisoners. I am living through theDemocrats\u2019 fascism right now. I sincerely pray that freedom, justice, and thetruth prevail on Tuesday, November 5 \u2013 or the damage done to me will spreadlike wildfire to the rest of our great Republic. But, as I wrote to you in anearlier letter, the Bible reminds us that our earthly possessions will alwaysfade, but greater \u201cheavenly treasures\u201d await us. The pursuit of truth,freedom, and justice are worth infinitely more than a car or a home.Possessions come and go, but I couldNEVER SURRENDER my fight for freedom andfor what I know to betrue. I would be tone deaf if I didn\u2019t acknowledge thattimes are tough right now for all Americans, not just me, so please stopreading here if you cannot give at this time.
