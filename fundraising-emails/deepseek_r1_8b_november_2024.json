In 2022, Adam Frischnearly defeated Lauren Boebert. He lost by just 546 votes. That scared LaurenBoebert so much that she came running to my district. But the voters ofeastern Colorado don\u2019t want a carpetbagging extremist more concerned withgetting on Fox News than the needs of her constituents. Even Republicans aredone with Boebert: 57% voted for someone else in the primary! We can finallykick Lauren Boebert out of Congress in November, but the only way I\u2019ll be ableto win is if we hit every fundraising goal and have the resources to fullyfund my campaign. We\u2019ve set a goal of raising another $250,000 before ourfinal end-of-month fundraising deadline, but right now, we\u2019re still incrediblyshort. So I have to ask: Please, if you can afford to, will you make adonation to my campaign \u2013 every dollar you can spare \u2013 to help me defeatLauren Boebert?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_calvarese?refcode=em20241031pm3-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=df8bfc39-e497-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Every dollar you give today will bring us one step closer to finally sendingLauren Boebert packing, and truly no amount you can afford is too small.

The Hill/Emerson Collegepoll showed Cruz leading by only one point. \u25ba Conservative former TV newsanchor Kari Lake is surging in Arizona and only trails liberal Ruben Gallegoby four points. But apparently, she's too conservative for Mitch McConnell,who refuses to spend the party's money to support her. There's still time forher to win in a state where President Trump is expanding his lead. \u25ba Armycombat veteran Sam Brown is rapidly gaining on incumbent Senator Jacky Rosenin Nevada. Republicans are doing exceptionally well with early voting, andBrown only trails by three points, according to the latest Rasmussen Reportspoll.

That\u2019s why I am so excited about Trisha\u2019s campaign: **New polling shows that Trisha can win and defeat Lauren Boebert! But Trisha can only flip this seat blue if she is able to raise enough money and fully fund her campaign.** I\u2019m ready to help Trisha Calvarese take on Lauren Boebert and finally kick her out of Congress, and I am asking you to join me today: **Please, will you make a donation right now to Trisha Calvarese\u2019s campaign to help her defeat Lauren Boebert this November? Winning this seat and turning it blue not only means getting rid of Boebert, but it will also get us one step closer to taking back the House for Democrats.** _Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  This election is about integrity and decency.

Even the local leftwing newspaper published an articleearlier this week describing their hypocrisy titled \u201cWhy some Democrats arenow running as border hawks.\u201d You can read the article HERE(https://arizonarepublic-az.newsmemory.com/?publink=205ab7a60_134d4aa&mc;_cid=56b415a5c2&mc;_eid=UNIQID).

        "body": "Peter, Friday November 1st marks the 3rd day of early voting here in Oklahoma.So what are the three things you need to know? First of all, there just sohappen to be 3 judges of the Oklahoma Supreme Court on the ballot. And theyare ALL liberal. They are all THREE appointed by Democrat Governors. And wehave the chance to remove all three at once. If WE vote NO on all threeliberal Supreme Court judges, they will be removed and can no longer be ableto force their liberal agenda on Oklahoma. The question on your ballot will beif Edmonson, Gurich, & Kauger should be retained in their current positions.And the answer is NO, they should not be retained. All three must go, so wemust all VOTE NO! Secondly, you\u2019ll be voting on several candidates beyond justthe President. We can all compare the economic boom with 4 years of PresidentTrump to the disastrous 4 years under Biden-Harris. If your mind isn\u2019t alreadymade up on who to vote for as President think of how much better off you were4 years ago & realize we can have that again. There are other candidates onthe ballot, so the easiest way to vote is to choose \u201cRepublican\u201d straightparty voting. That\u2019ll make your selection for all those races & help put inRepublicans at the State & local level to help restore our economy & keep moremoney in your pockets. And third, you\u2019ll also have two State Questions on yourballot. SQ833 creates new tax structures. Many people are torn on how to votefor this, but we\u2019ll just put out there that we don\u2019t believe the governmentneeds MORE ways to tax us. If you agree we don\u2019t need more tax options, you\u2019llvote no on this one. As for SQ834 it would clarify that ONLY citizens can votein Oklahoma elections. It\u2019s obvious part of the Biden-Harris open border planis to get more people voting, including non-citizens. In fact a dozen citiesalready allow non-citizens to vote INCLUDING Washington DC! We must secure ourelections by allowing ONLY citizens to vote. Otherwise liberal court judges(refer to the first item listed above!) will allow law-breaking foreigners tovote in our elections. So there you have it, the three things you need toknow. 1) Vote no on all THREE Supreme Court judges. 2) Vote Republicanstraight party. 3) On the State Questions vote for lower taxes & ONLY citizensvoting. -Team OKGOP -=-=- Paid for by OKGOP and not authorized by anycandidate or candidate's committee. www.OKGOP.com - (405) 528-3501. 4031 N.Linconln Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK 73105 This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.

Friend, I was just boots on the ground at the border in New Mexico, once again assessing the situation and reminding voters justhow bad Kamala Harris and Martin Heinrich have allowed it to become. Of course, \u201cbad\u201d is the understatement of the century. Words and phrases like \u201chorrifying,\u201d \u201cdeadly,\u201d and \u201cworst in history\u201d get closer to appropriate descriptions of what has happened under their watch. And it\u2019s not like they just allowed it to happen \u2013 they curated this disaster! There\u2019s NO WAY we can allow Harris or Heinrich to continue failing us in Washington, D.C., and I need your help to defeat them and their radical agenda here in New Mexico. I am ready to get to work on DAY ONE with Pres. Trump to secure our borders and fix what the left has broken. We\u2019re so close to the finish line, and I need your help to get across. Please rush $10 or more to help us keep fighting every minute all the way until the end, when we\u2019ve flipped this seat, secured the Senate, and ensured we have the ability to get our country back on track. Thank you, Nella Domenici Help Elect Nella and Secure the Border \u00bb ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

        "body": "Please read this full message Fellow Patriot, At West Point, we had a code:cadets don't lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do. First the New YorkTimes lied about my childhood and family, and now CNN is lying about mybusiness record. And what\u2019s worse, they are doing it all because I\u2019m withinstriking distance of an entrenched career politician, Bob Casey, in the #1swing state in the nation that will determine control of the U.S Senate. BobCasey is getting Leftist news sources to do his dirty work, and I WON\u2019TTOLERATE IT. Here's the truth: this is a long message and I hope you will readall the way to the end. I grew up in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. We lived oncampus at Bloomsburg State College and my parents owned a farm ten minutesdown the road. I had summer jobs baling hay and trimming Christmas trees atnearby farms. My dad started his career teaching history, economics, &democracy at Punxsutawney High. My mom began teaching fourth through sixthgraders at a public school near Pittsburgh. I\u2019m incredibly proud that my dadwas chosen to be president of Bloomsburg State College (now BloomsburgUniversity) at only 34 years old. I\u2019m so proud of my parents\u2019 teachingcareers and to have been raised in Bloomsburg. It was there that I wrestledand played football and was nominated to the U.S. Military Academy at WestPoint. And it was there that I came home to a parade after serving in combatduring the Gulf War. After the Army, I earned a Ph.D. in internationalrelations before moving to Pittsburgh to start a career in business. I workedmy way up to become the CEO of FreeMarkets, a successful tech startup thatemployed hundreds in Western Pennsylvania. I was then called to serviceagain, this time in the highest levels of government as Under Secretary ofTreasury and as Deputy National Security Advisor. Following this, I joinedBridgewater Associates, one of the largest, most successful investment firmsin the world, which manages the pension plans of groups including teachers,firefighters and law enforcement. I have lived the American Dream, and I amrunning for Senate to bring my decades of experience and love for our countryto fix our broken economy that is a direct result of policies supported by myopponent, who has spent 18 years in Washington with NOTHING to show for it. Iknew getting into this race could mean things would get nasty, but it\u2019s sad tosee we\u2019ve fallen so far that these media outlets like the New York Times andCNN are pushing the Democrats\u2019 baked narrative about my upbringing and mybusiness record. I\u2019ve opened myself and my family up to attacks from theleft, and every day feels like a battle. But I\u2019m no stranger to fighting forwhat is right andif we don\u2019t elect leaders to go to DC to clean up the messthe career politicians made, we will lose America as we know it! Here\u2019s whereI need your help, Fellow Patriot. We need to combat these lies with the TRUTHabout me. The Democrats are seeing the same polls you and I see. They know ifKamala Harris and Bob Casey lose Pennsylvania, they lose it ALL, and they aregoing to do WHATEVER IT TAKES to try and defeat me. I hate asking for money \u2014I\u2019m not a career politician, and it\u2019s not in my nature \u2014 but I have no choicebut to ask if we\u2019re going to hit our fundraising goal for the final stretch ofthe campaign.Will you chip in $30 or more right now to fight back against thelies from the Left? Chuck Schumer and his allies are working overtime toobliterate my campaign. They have committed to spend whatever it takes todefeat me.They know if I win this race in Pennsylvania, it\u2019ll be IMPOSSIBLEfor Democrats to keep their majority in the Senate. If we don\u2019t show theDemocrats we can win this race, it\u2019s game over. That\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping you canspare$29, $50, or even $100 to help me fight back against the lies. DONATEYour donation will take us one step closer to victory, and I am so gratefulfor your support. Thank you, Dave McCormick P.S. Democrats from all over thecountry are pouring money into this race to defeat me because they know thisrace could flip the Senate red.Will you chip in $29 or more to make sure Ihave the resources to WIN?

I\u2019m fired up, Peter! The energy at President Trump\u2019s rally in Albuquerque today was palpable. I could feel it on stage while delivering my own remarks, and it was apparent to anyone who was there todaythat something special is happening in New Mexico. We\u2019re on the cusp of flipping this state red and electing new leadership that will secure our border, lower our cost of living, get tough on crime, improve education, and unleash our abundant natural resources. I need you to keep fighting every single day, every single moment, until the polls close on Tuesday. Our campaign is working 24/7 to reach remaining undecided voters and get out the vote.

Thank you, Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Ultimately, this election isabout two different visions for our nation. One focused on the future. And onefocused on the past. Jacky Rosen and I believe in a future where every personhas the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. Where no child hasto grow up in poverty. Where every worker has the freedom to join a union.Where every person has affordable health care, child care, and paid leave.Where every senior can retire with dignity. But Donald Trump and his extremistRepublican allies want to take our country backward. They intend to cut SocialSecurity and Medicare, to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporationsand to make working families foot the bill, and end the Affordable Care Act.America has tried these failed policies before. We are not going back.Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, the batonis in our hands. To protect the right to vote. To get assault weapons off ofour streets. To restore reproductive freedom, reversing Donald Trump's extremeabortion bans. Jacky Rosen is running for reelection to continue deliveringfor Nevadans. In the Senate, she has never hesitated to take on powerfulspecial interests to bring down costs for hardworking Nevada families. If youare ready to join us in the fight for freedom and opportunity for all, pleasesplit a donation of $5 to our campaigns.

Here\u2019s exactly what$5 can buy a campaign to reach voters: * 250 digital ad impressions * 8 piecesof mail * 10 doors canvassed (you can increase this number by volunteering!)In many close races, voter turnout will determine the final outcome. Campaignsare in high-gear trying to get as many supporters as they can to the polls.Voter contact efforts, made possible by your $5 donation, remind people what\u2019sat stake and how important it is for them to make their voices heard.

That's the amount Arizona Senator Mark Kelly won his Senateseat by in 2020. 0.3%. That's Joe Biden's margin of victory over Donald Trumpin Arizona in 2020. 0.67%. That's the amount Kari Lake lost by in 2022 in theArizona gubernatorial race. $150 million. That's how much money is being spenton political TV ads during this campaign cycle in Arizona. The bottom line?Arizona is a state where elections are won by the narrowest of margins, andwith millions being spent against Ruben, this race will likely be nodifferent. We have under a week until Election Day, and votes are being castright now . The last thing we can afford is for right-wing messaging to drownout Ruben's voice and boost an extremist like Kari Lake.

Polls are currently flipping back and forth between me and myopponent. At this point, our race is a total tossup. Every dollar we raisehelps us reach more undecided voters, and in a race that will come down tojust a handful of votes, that makes all the difference. My millionaireopponent and his far-right allies are funneling MILLIONS into our districtbecause they know it\u2019ll determine who controls Congress. The only way we canfight back and make sure we get the last word with voters is with yoursupport. So I\u2019m personally asking, will you donate by midnight to ensure wehave the resources to win on Election Day?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kmr-email-october24?refcode=email_103124_halloween Happy Halloween \ud83c\udf83 !

Can I count onyou to step up with a split donation of $10 between my campaign and DefeatBoebert PAC today to ensure my team and I have the resources we need to pushback against the $40 million worth of attack ads Ted Cruz and his allies arerunning against us right now? RUSH MY DONATION Last time around, Ted Cruzwon his race by just over 2% of the vote \u2013 that was a difference of about215,000 votes, Peter. I remember how it felt watching the results roll in onNovember 6, 2018, and let me tell you, it was a nail-biter. I have no doubtsthat this year will be when we finally send Ted Cruz packing. But despitebeing closer than ever to defeating Ted, we've still got a lot more work to doand only a handful of days left to do it. I know seeing a number like $3million can feel overwhelming, but if thousands of hardworking folks like youchip in $5 here, $25 there, and the occasional $100, we will be able tocollectively reach this critical goal. So please, will you chip in a splitdonation between my campaign and Defeat Boebert PAC of $10 or whatever you canafford now so I can hit my final end-of-month goal and flip Texas blue? We'vegot zero time left to go, so let's get it done, Peter!

With Election Dayaround the corner, right now is the most critical time to surge support forEMILYs List women up and down the ballot. Let me explain: Over the past month,I've been on the ground in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, and a few other keystates. I've talked to voters, candidates, and volunteers all across thecountry. And I can tell you firsthand that the polls and the pundits areright: our women's races will be close. There's a saying in politics, belovedby fundraisers and field organizers alike: the margin of effort. When thepolls are tight, and a race could go either way, what matters most is theheart, grit, and commitment of the supporters. If we put in the work, we'llwin. If we don't, we won't. It's that simple. Critical races like VP KamalaHarris', Sen. Tammy Baldwin's (WI-SEN), and Rep. Susan Wild's (PA-07) now fallsquarely within the margin of effort. And your support can help make sure wereach as many voters as possible before Nov. 5. Let's give it all we've got,Peter.

But this year, Kirsten is facing an incredibly tough fight at the ballot box. Democrats are defending a massive 23 seats, meaning our grassroots resources are spread incredibly thin. And in 2022, New York saw the biggest red wave across the country. Now, those same extremists are working overtime to defeat Kirsten and retake control of the Senate. There's no way Kirsten backs down from this fight.

Trust me, this is the only way that Kirsten will win. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_fr_defend-senate-2024?refcode=jtk5593-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 In everything that she does \u2014 every fight that she takes on, every piece of legislation that she supports, and every constituent that she advocates for \u2014 Kirsten is absolutely relentless. That's what makes her such an incredible advocate for Americans around the country (and one of the most powerful allies that you can have here in the Senate). Now, more than ever, New Yorkers, Democrats, and all Americans need Kirsten's bold voice in Congress. Because today, our most fundamental rights are under unprecedented attack from extremist Republicans. We're in a national emergency for our democracy and all of the values we hold dear. Kirsten and I are fighting every day to safeguard these rights. We're working to pass voting rights legislation that will ensure every single American has equal, unrestricted access to the ballot box. And we're rallying support to certify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would give us a legal basis to restore reproductive rights nationwide. But to continue these fights, and save our Senate majority, Kirsten needs your help: The only way to defeat the GOP's megadonors is with strong grassroots support from folks like you. So please, friend, if you have anything to spare today, will you rush a donation now to help Kirsten protect her seat so that we can continue to fight for your family in the Senate? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_fr_defend-senate-2024?refcode=jtk5593-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for all that you do, Sen.

There's a strong chance it will all come down to Ohio, which meansSherrod is the ONLY thing standing between us and a Republican Senate. Friend,I've worked on campaigns for a long time. I've been on the winning side andthe losing side. If there's one thing I know, it's that money makes a BIGdifference. I wish it weren't the case, but it is. TV ads, phone banks, yardsigns, campaign events in every corner of the state \u2013 it all adds up FAST.That's why I'm so terrified right now. If this were a simple battle betweengood and evil, I wouldn't be worried \u2013 Sherrod is as good a leader as Ohioanshave ever had. He fights harder for workers than anybody I know, and he's notafraid to take on the big banks and corporations that are making things harderfor the middle class. But money muddies the waters, and his opponent has got aton of it. He's poured A TON into his own campaign, and there's a lot morewhere that came from. Sherrod simply doesn't have that kind of money \u2013 sothat's where this grassroots team needs to come in and have his back, friend.I know Sherrod can win this critical race and keep the Senate blue, but ONLYIF we all come together to give him the resources he needs.

Six days from rightnow, voters will decide the future of America. I'm looking at the early votetotals and I'll be completely upfront with you\u2026 I'm beyond worried. I'mpetrified. The Democrat voter turnout/ballot harvesting machine is chargingfull speed ahead to rob Donald Trump of the presidency, steal the House, andhold the line in the Senate. At this point, we could wake up on November 6thto a full Democrat takeover of America. That's why President Trump and I areworking hand in glove to save the country.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bI'm campaigning on stage with him. I'm traveling to swing states like Michiganto turn out voters. And I'm rallying Republican voters in Tennessee and beyondto win. The only problem is I'm about $80,000 short of my fundraising goalright now. I'm scared that if I don't make up the lost ground, I'll have toshut down our voter turnout operation for the final stretch of the election. Ididn't want to burden you with this but I'm out of options. I'm forced to cometo you - with my hat in hand - to plead with you for help. If you can spareeven a few dollars, it would mean a great deal to me.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bCONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT If you canhttps://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=3372522aa57f407eaa430ae5ebed75acbac89428cb1965f7b0112d59d549fcac99ea989a867aa1c41d5ad1d880cd951cd0220f2caeea488bpitch in $100 - $250, it would make a huge dent in my budget shortfall andchange everything.

If every Conservative gave at leastthis much, the Democrats would be out of power for a generation. All I ask isthat you donate something before Election Day. I'm afraid that if too manyfolks sit on the sidelines - and decide not to give - the Democrats will walkaway with this election. Do not let this happen.

These justices and their MAGA pals Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas have gutted the EPA, slashed voting rights, and overturned Roe v. Wade. This far-right majority doesn\u2019t represent the values of the majority of Americans, so it\u2019s past time we ensured the court wasn\u2019t a cesspool of MAGA extremists. That\u2019s why President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to enact term limits for justices is so critical. Instead of having a MAGA majority for decades, we could at regular intervals nominate justices who aren\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s hand-picked weirdos! This plan is incredible for democracy and reproductive rights, but it will need a groundswell of support if we are going to get it done. Will you sign our petition today demanding that Congress pass Joe Biden\u2019s Supreme Court term limits plan?

It's timeto finally hold him accountable and we're SO CLOSE to doing that \u2013 but Cruzand his allies are spending over $40 million in a last-ditch effort to stop us\u2013 all while Texans are beginning to cast their ballots!

        "All right, so I need to analyze this email and create a JSON object based on the user's instructions. Let me break it down step by step. First, the user wants two keys in the JSON: 'committee' and 'sender'. The committee should be the name of the committee mentioned in the disclaimer that starts with 'Paid for by' but shouldn't include the address or treasurer's name. If there's no such committee, then 'committee' is set to None. The 'sender' key should be the person named as the author of the email; if none are mentioned, it's None.": "Okay, looking at the provided email, I need to find where 'Paid for by' is used. Scanning through the text, I see a line that says 'Checks can be made payable to Nella for Senate...' and then mentions the PO Box. So the committee here is 'Nella for Senate'. It starts with 'Paid for by', so that fits the criteria. There's no address or treasurer mentioned alongside it, just the name of the committee. Good, so 'committee' is 'Nella for Senate'.",
        "Now for the 'sender': the email is signed off by Nella Domenici, and she refers to herself as the author. She mentions her background and talks about her campaign. So the sender's name should be 'Nella Domenici'. There's no other person mentioned as the author, so that's clear.": "Putting it all together, the JSON object will have 'committee' set to 'Nella for Senate' and 'sender' set to 'Nella Domenici'. No other text is needed beyond these two keys. I should make sure there are no typos or formatting issues in the JSON.",
        "Let me double-check if there's any other committee mentioned besides the 'Paid for by' one. The email doesn't mention any other committees, just this one. And as for the sender, it seems Nella is both the candidate and the primary author of the email, so that should be correct.": "So final JSON should look like { ",

Thank you, Nella Domenici Help Elect Nella and Secure the Border \u00bb ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Iknow it\u2019s getting late, but I wanted to reach out one last time before themonth ends. Right now, with just hours left until our final end-of-monthdeadline of the campaign, we\u2019re just shy of hitting $30,000. Peter, I don\u2019tthink I need to emphasize just how critical TX-15 is. This is the SOLEcompetitive House race in the state of Texas, and what we do here will definethe road to the House majority on November 5. Not to mention I\u2019m up againstMonica De La Cruz, who is as MAGA extremist, anti-choice, anti-seniors, anti-workers, anti-Texas as they come. Now what\u2019s spookier than that? With exactly5 days left until the election, we can\u2019t afford a single misstep or risk. Wehave to win this thing, folks \u2014 the future of Texas and democracy at largedepends on it. And if we\u2019re going to make that happen, we need ALL theresources possible to supercharge our campaign. So before you sign off for thenight, can I count on you to make a gift of ANY amount you can to support thiscampaign?

The onlything left that Debbie needs to win is a sizable grassroots cash infusion overthe last 5 days \u2014 especially before her last $10 million end-of-month deadlinetonight.

Ithought that would be the end of the damage\u2026 But with the election rightaround the corner, Kamala\u2019s Deep State truly wants to ruin me with all they\u2019vegot. They\u2019re now considering dealing one final blow to me. A judge may noworder me to give up my remaining home in Florida \u2013 my primary residence. As mylawyer inquired: do they truly want me homeless? Over the last few days, we\u2019veheard ridiculous claims about President Trump being a \u201cfascist.\u201d Let me tellyou what fascism is\u2026 Fascism is weaponizing the legal system to punish yourpolitical opponents. Fascism is having your home taken from you. Fascism istaking the law license away from your opponent\u2019s lawyer. Fascism is trying toturn your enemies into political prisoners. I am living through theDemocrats\u2019 fascism right now. I sincerely pray that freedom, justice, and thetruth prevail on Tuesday, November 5 \u2013 or the damage done to me will spreadlike wildfire to the rest of our great Republic. But, as I wrote to you in anearlier letter, the Bible reminds us that our earthly possessions will alwaysfade, but greater \u201cheavenly treasures\u201d await us. The pursuit of truth,freedom, and justice are worth infinitely more than a car or a home.Possessions come and go, but I couldNEVER SURRENDER my fight for freedom andfor what I know to betrue. I would be tone deaf if I didn\u2019t acknowledge thattimes are tough right now for all Americans, not just me, so please stopreading here if you cannot give at this time. But funding my Legal DefenseTrust is my last remaining hope of fighting for my freedom and for the libertyand justice of all Americans. So, if you can, and, seriously, only if you can,please make a contribution to my Legal Defense Trust \u2013 the Rudy GiulianiFreedom Fund \u2013 as I keep fighting for my freedom and justice as Kamala\u2019s DeepState tries to JAIL me for life.

UnlikeRick Scott, I don't have a massive fortune at my campaign's disposal. I comefrom a working-class family, so I know my eye-watering $4 million goal isnothing to shake a stick at. But it's the only way I'll be able to defeat him.If that's all you need to hear, please click here to chip in $10 now \u2014 but I'dlike to share what your hard-earned $10 means to me.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text See, my family moved to the United States from Ecuador with big dreamsfor a better life when I was 14. But it didn't come easy, and despite my momworking back-to-back double shifts, we still struggled to afford rent on ourone room apartment. So once I turned 15, I began taking early morning shiftsat a doughnut shop before school. It wasn't much, but the extra cash gave myfamily room to breathe, and eventually, the life we dreamt of finally cametrue. But I'm not the only one who got their start in the doughnut business.When he was a young man, my opponent, Rick Scott, bought two doughnut shops.While I made minimum wage to help keep the lights on at home, he reaped thebenefits of his employees' hard work. For me, those $10 boxes of doughnutswere a lifeline that helped my family get by. For him, they kicked off acareer in penthouse C-suites. And with your $10, you can help me kick Rick outof the Senate on election night \u2014 so please, pitch in now.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text I went on to graduate college, fight to improve life for working familieslike my own, and become the first South American immigrant elected toCongress. Rick Scott went on to enrich himself off U.S. taxpayers via thelargest Medicare fraud scheme in history, amass a nine-figure fortune, and buyhis way into the Senate. So I don't take your help toward reaching my $4million goal lightly. There's simply no way I could ever do it on my own. Myopponent, however, can spend $4 million to get his ads on screens withoutthinking twice \u2014 and he has already spent plenty more to stop me. So the onlyway we'll get him out and give working Floridians the Senate representation wedeserve is if we hit my $4 million goal. Please, friend: Will you give just$10 \u2014 about the cost of a dozen doughnuts \u2014 to help me retire Rick Scott?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2462-fr-text This campaign is powered by small-dollar donations, so every cent makes abig difference.

Can I count on you to step up with a split donation of $10 today to ensure my team and I have the resources we need to push back against the $40 million worth of attack ads Ted Cruz and his allies are running against us right now? https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Last time around, Ted Cruz won his race by just over 2% of the vote \u2013 that was a difference of about 215,000 votes, friend. I remember how it felt watching the results roll in on November 6, 2018, and let me tell you, it was a nail-biter. I have no doubts that this year will be when we finally send Ted Cruz packing. But despite being closer than ever to defeating Ted, we've still got a lot more work to do and only a handful of days left to do it. I know seeing a number like $500,000 can feel overwhelming, but if thousands of hardworking folks like you chip in $5 here, $25 there, and the occasional $100, we will be able to collectively reach this critical goal. So please, will you chip in a split donation between my campaign and Kirsten Gillibrand's of $10 or whatever you can afford now so I can hit my daily fundraising goal and flip Texas blue? We've got zero time left to go, so let's get it done, friend! https://secure.actblue.com/donate/gfs_colinallred?refcode=jtk5609-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thanks for being on my team, Colin Allred -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

Your generosity has allowed us to build a top-notchteam, craft cutting-edge campaigns, and fight the Democrat machine.  But I know that our success isn't just about House Republicans - **it's aboutthe countless hours you've volunteered, your thoughtful survey responses, andthe contributions you've given to fuel our movement. You're the unsung hero ofour party, and I'm honored to stand alongside you in this fight.**  Now, as we sprint to the finish line, I need your help one more time if youcan spare a few dollars.  **We're facing a fierce battle in the final days of this election, and everydollar counts. That's why I'm humbly asking you to make a final contributionto help defend our razor-thin House Majority.**  Your donation will go directly towards our Get Out the Vote efforts,advertising, and other key pieces of our campaign operation. It will help usdefend our vulnerable incumbents, _flip key seats, and elect a new generationof conservative leaders._  If you can swing it, one last contribution would mean the world to me, but ifnot, please don't stress, you've done so much for us already.

THEN: Trumpunleashed a new wave of attacks against Jacky Rosen and planned a massive MAGArally with Jacky\u2019s extreme opponent to shore up support and seal the deal inNevada. NOW: The biggest super PAC for Senate Republicans is spending over $6MILLION in Nevada in just the final days of this race to blindside JackyRosen\u2019s campaign and pummel her with deceptive attack ads in the final stretchof the election. We\u2019re already walking a tightrope, and this new GOP ad buy isthrowing us completely off balance. Polling already shows Jacky Rosen losingground to her Trump-endorsed opponent, and we need to take immediate action orwe could fall into too deep of a hole to climb out of before Election Day.Please, if we don\u2019t respond TODAY, these ads could wreck months of hard workright when we need our momentum the most.

My team just let me know that we came up short of our October fundraising goal last night. This was always going to be an uphill battle. We had to raise our goals multiple times throughout the month to keep up with the tens of millions of dollars Republicans continue to spend on brutal attack ads against me. Now, I won\u2019t tell you that the sky is falling because we missed this goal. But I will tell you the truth, which is that we\u2019re starting November with a significant gap in our budget. That\u2019s a problem because if we need to cut back on our campaign ads or get-out-the-vote efforts this late in the race, Republicans could easily flip this battleground seat. Staying competitive in this toss-up race isn\u2019t as easy for me as tapping into a multimillion-dollar personal fortune like my opponent can. Instead, I rely on folks like you who pitch in what you can, when you can, to help power our campaign.

Bernie Moreno GOPNominee for Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fights for theAmerican Dream because he\u2019s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota, Colombia. Atage five, his American Dream began when he moved to the United States with hisfamily. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Through his relentlesswork ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned the first cardealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largest dealership groupsin America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value and transformationalpotential of blockchain technology, before it received mainstream attention,and moved much of his volunteer time and investment dollars into the space. In2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to be quite successful as Bernieserved as Chairman of the Board. After a long, successful career, Bernie soldmost of his business to begin focusing on his calling: protecting the Americandream for another generation. Solving our country\u2019s problems requires commonsense. In Washington, Bernie will fight to shrink government, protect ourfreedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party from taking our data and land, andalways put America First. Ohioans are done with politicians who talk a biggame and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. to get work done \u2013 just likehe always has.

We all know it. The only people who can afford to runfor Senate full-time are millionaires like my opponent, Republican DebFischer. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the only people who ever win. It\u2019s why the Senateis just another country club full of Ivy League graduates, former businessexecs, and trust fund babies. Working people like me, we can\u2019t afford to giveup our jobs to run for office. During this campaign, I\u2019ve been working 40, 60,sometimes 90 hours a week as a steamfitter just to pay our bills and put foodon the table. How\u2019s anybody with a real job supposed to campaign and win whenyour opponent is wealthy enough to not work at all? That\u2019s why I announcedthat I was taking a leave from my job as a steamfitter to campaign full-timefor the U.S. Senate and keep up our momentum. And yes, that means I\u2019m going toneed to take a salary from our campaign. Not a big one. Just enough to replacethe $48,000 I got paid last year and the cost of health care for me and myfamily. Politics shouldn\u2019t only be for the rich, and this is the only way wecan change that. Five brand-new polls show me narrowly LEADING my opponent,Republican Deb Fischer \u2013 and according to FiveThirtyEight, this is now theCLOSEST Senate race in the country. With support from grassroots donors likeyou, we out-raised Fischer, but Mitch McConnell is spending over $13.1 millionon TV ads attacking me. Together, we are charting the path for how a bluecollar, union worker can run for U.S. Senate \u2013 and win. But I need grassrootsdonors like you to chip in to my campaign right now if we\u2019re going to defeatRepublican Deb Fischer and flip this Senate seat: Please, will you make adonation to my campaign right now \u2013 no amount you can afford is too small \u2013 tohelp me defeat Republican Deb Fischer and flip this Senate seat in November?[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email_osborn?refcode=em20241101am-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=57e61702-4d98-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]I\u2019m not rich.

NowI\u2019m known for making some pretty bold statements, but this is no exaggeration:Rick Scott is pushing an agenda so extreme, even Mitch McConnell wants nothingto do with it. I\u2019m talking about ending Social Security and Medicare, raisingtaxes on working families, a national ban on abortions, and so much more. I\u2019mscared half to death thinking about what could happen if we give this guy 6more years in Washington \u2014 especially with MAGA extremists on the cusp ofretaking the Senate. But right now, Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is fallingdangerously short of her LAST $4 million fundraising goal ahead of ElectionDay. I\u2019m asking you to take the gloves off and go on the offensive with me:Please, will you donate $5 or more to help Debbie flip Florida blue and saveour Senate majority?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2463-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Listen, just about anyone can see that a bluewave is building in Florida. As folks from all across the state rally behindDebbie\u2019s campaign, polling data shows that this race against extremist RickScott is a dead heat. And that barely scratches the surface: Even with theextreme abortion ban officially in effect, Florida Democrats secured areproductive rights ballot initiative this November and won a critical specialelection, flipping a pivotal state House district from red to blue. That\u2019s whyDemocratic leaders like my friend Chuck Schumer, and even President Biden, areall in on Florida this year. They\u2019ve announced HUGE investments to make surethat voters learn the truth about Rick Scott\u2019s record. This state is ready toflip blue \u2014 but we\u2019ve all got to have Debbie\u2019s back in this fight. So I\u2019masking one final time: PLEASE, will you donate $5 or as much as you can spareright now to make sure that Debbie has everything that she needs to take onRick Scott and defeat him?https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2463-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for taking the time to read thisemail.

The outcome of November\u2019s election will shape the trajectory of ourlives, impacting our families, our economy, and our national security foryears to come.

The polls show we areTIED, which means any donation you can spare right now could put me over thetop. Radical Democrats like Slotkin are selling Michigan out to foreigninterests, crippling our auto industry, and hiking up the cost of living \u2014putting a strain on every American living paycheck to paycheck. Under theHarris-Slotkin agenda, hardworking families are struggling to make ends meet.Meanwhile, I\u2019ve spent my entire career defending this country, serving as anofficer in the U.S. Army and a Special Agent in the FBI, and working inCongress to protect American workers and fight for your values. This electionis crucial. We can\u2019t allow Washington elites to keep jeopardizing our economyand security. Together, we will secure Michigan\u2019s future. So, what do yousay?

At age five, his American Dream began when he moved to theUnited States with his family. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18.Through his relentless work ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, heturned the first car dealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of thelargest dealership groups in America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value andtransformational potential of blockchain technology, before it receivedmainstream attention, and moved much of his volunteer time and investmentdollars into the space. In 2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to bequite successful as Bernie served as Chairman of the Board. After a long,successful career, Bernie sold most of his business to begin focusing on hiscalling: protecting the American dream for another generation. Solving ourcountry\u2019s problems requires common sense. In Washington, Bernie will fight toshrink government, protect our freedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party fromtaking our data and land, and always put America First. Ohioans are done withpoliticians who talk a big game and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. toget work done \u2013 just like he always has.

Republican state Rep.Webster Barnaby filed the 40-page proposal \u2014 called the \"Florida HeartbeatAct\" \u2014 on Wednesday. It would prevent physicians from performing abortions ifthere is a \"detectable fetal heartbeat,\" effectively banning abortions afterabout six weeks into pregnancy, before many people even know they arepregnant. ] We have said it before and we\u2019ll say it again: MEN SHOULD NOT BEMAKING LAWS ABOUT WOMEN\u2019S BODIES! Rosemarie is a single mother of daughters.She has been a nurse for 43 years, and a nurse practitioner for 25 years. Shehas decades of experience caring for women 16 and over, including providingthem with reproductive healthcare. Through this experience, she has directlyengaged in the triumphs and challenges of our healthcare system and has seenthe ripple effect on people\u2019s lives. \u201cThe exam room isn\u2019t big enough to fitme, my patient, and Florida\u2019s government.\u201d This is why Rosemarie chose to runfor office. Because she is determined to do everything she can for women\u2019shealth and safety. The same cannot be said about her opponent. We are sick andtired of men making dangerous laws about our bodies and our lives. We areworking hard to restore abortion access in Florida.

Everything we\u2019ve worked toward comes down to these final moments \u2014 and I want to take a moment to say thank you for standing with me every step of the way. This journey has been full of challenges and hard work \u2014 from mobilizing voters and supporting Democratic candidates here in California and the rest of the country to the attacks from Trump and his MAGA allies. Through it all, I\u2019ve been inspired by the way this team has rallied behind me and the issues that matter most to them and their families. Your unwavering support has made all of this possible \u2014 and now we\u2019re just days away from the finish line. We have the opportunity to keep the Senate blue, flip the House, and ensure we can move forward together \u2014 every conversation, every volunteer, every dollar raised, and every vote counts in this work. It\u2019s not just about what we\u2019re fighting against \u2014 it\u2019s about what we\u2019re fighting for. So let\u2019s make sure every voter knows what\u2019s at stake and how much better our future can be. Thank you again for everything you\u2019ve done so far.

It\u2019s clear that the GOP wants to stoke fear about LGBTQ+Americans in hopes these anti-gay, anti-trans messages will win out withvoters and implement a red wave on November 5.

Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day. So our kids grow up in democracy, not dystopia. Thank you for your support for all we do!

For American Greatness!Bernie Moreno GOP Nominee for Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Morenofights for the American Dream because he\u2019s lived it. Bernie was born inBogota, Colombia. At age five, his American Dream began when he moved to theUnited States with his family. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18.Through his relentless work ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, heturned the first car dealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of thelargest dealership groups in America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value andtransformational potential of blockchain technology, before it receivedmainstream attention, and moved much of his volunteer time and investmentdollars into the space. In 2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to bequite successful as Bernie served as Chairman of the Board. After a long,successful career, Bernie sold most of his business to begin focusing on hiscalling: protecting the American dream for another generation. Solving ourcountry\u2019s problems requires common sense. In Washington, Bernie will fight toshrink government, protect our freedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party fromtaking our data and land, and always put America First. Ohioans are done withpoliticians who talk a big game and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. toget work done \u2013 just like he always has.

So we can\u2019t leave them any room to deny thatKamala Harris will be our next President, Peter! We have to get every lastDemocrat to the polls, turn out a record number of voters to support her, andget a Blue Wave going from the White House down! But we can\u2019t win without you.Right now, Kamala and Trump are locked in a neck-and-neck race to the finishline, Democrats are at risk of losing the Senate, and so much is on the lineon Election Night. Can we count on you to chip in $15 or more to Blue AmpAction today so we can invest in getting Kamala and other key Democratselected? Your support will allow us to send money where it\u2019s needed most,combat misinformation, and show Trump once and for all that the Americanpeople REJECT him and his extremist views. Your support will give Democratsthe momentum they need to pull ahead in this critical moment and WIN. Soplease, Peter, can you chip in any amount to Blue Amp Action today? With just3 days left to guarantee Democrats can keep the White House, maintain theirSenate majority, and flip the House, anything you can give will go a long way. --- | | DONATE --- | Thank you! \\- The Team @ Blue Amp Action --- | --- | | |  --- | --- | | |  --- | | | | |  --- | | | ![](https://default.salsalabs.org/fde5f520-5281-42ed-9182-51d72f7d8617/bdd7c5f5-7de1-4347-b64e-b4284329efec.png) | Cliff Schecter President, Blue Amp Action Amplify Good  ---|--- | | |  --- | | Follow Us | ![](https://blueampstrategies.salsalabs.org/public/images/icons/medium-auto_twitter2.png) | ![](https://blueampstrategies.salsalabs.org/public/images/icons/medium-auto_linkedin.png) ---|---  | **Blue Amp Action PAC** PO Box 8384, Cincinnati, OH 45208 --- | Having trouble viewing this email?

Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day. So our kids grow up in democracy, not dystopia. Thank you for your support for all we do!

So I wanted to take a few minutes to tell you about my decision to run for president \u2013 and why your support for the DLCC and my campaign is so important to our success on Election Day in four days. Before I continue, if you\u2019re short on time, will you split a donation between the DLCC and my campaign at my personal link below? https://dlcc.org/dlcc-hfp **The truth is: I am no stranger to unlikely journeys.** Where I grew up in the Bay, you either live in the hills or the flatlands. We lived in the flats. It was a working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the civil rights movement, and at a young age I decided I wanted to be a lawyer. I wanted to protect people because I believe everyone has a right to safety, dignity, and justice. Today, my decision to run for president has everything to do with this opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past. We have the chance to chart a new way forward \u2013 not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans. I want you to know that I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens, who is realistic, practical, and has common sense. A president who always fights for the American people. I cannot do it alone. No one person could. It takes a team. It takes millions and millions of people coming together at once to shape the outcome of this election and elect Democrats up and down the ballot. If we are going to win this election and elect Democrats in swing districts across our country, I need you to step up and join this team. Millions of Americans have already voted, and millions more will vote on Election Day. And we need to do everything we can \u2013 and I mean everything \u2013 to reach every last voter to win the White House and elect Democrats to state legislatures across the country. **So, with time running out to make an impact before Election Day, I am asking for your support one last time:** Will you help us get out the vote over these final days by splitting $10, or whatever you can afford, between the DLCC and my campaign before our midnight deadline? Every dollar will help us reach more voters and elect Democrats in key swing districts before the polls close on Election Day. | If you've stored your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately and be split between DLCC PAC and the Harris-Walz campaign.  --- | $10 \u00bb --- | $25 \u00bb --- | $50 \u00bb --- | $100 \u00bb --- | $250 \u00bb --- | Other \u00bb ---  From the bottom of my heart: Thank you for everything.

        "body": "[http://adamforcolorado.com]http://adamforcolorado.com[http://adamforcolorado.com] Hello, The day before the anniversary of theSupreme Court\u2019s disastrous Dobbs decision, I woke up to Fox News and LaurenBoebert attacking my sister and my 81-year-old father. For decades, Dad was anOB-GYN. He delivered thousands of babies and wrote books on how to getpregnant and to navigate menopause. Dad provided women with full access to allkinds of reproductive health care, including abortions, in the years rightafter Roe \u2013 and he has now had to watch as women\u2019s reproductive rights aregutted in the aftermath of Dobbs . Dad and his clinic faced many threats overthe years. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that he put his own safety \u2013 and thatof his family \u2013 at risk in order to protect the rights of women to make theirown medical decisions. But I\u2019m not sure he ever expected to see a sittingmember of Congress attacking him \u2013 or my sister who followed in his footsteps\u2013 in a national news outlet. It\u2019s disgusting. These kinds of personal attacksagainst my family have no place in our politics and do nothing to serve thepeople of Western and Southern Colorado. If extremists like Lauren Boebert andmy new Republican opponent want to have a conversation about reproductiverights in this country, I am more than happy to have that debate. We can talkabout how I support freedom and liberty \u2013 and how they support big governmentintruding into the lives of women. We can talk about how they support anational ban on abortion \u2013 with no exceptions for rape, incest, or the life ofthe mother. And we can talk about how they are so extreme, they even want toban the pill that\u2019s been used by women for decades. I am willing to talk allday about the fringe view that the government should be dictating women\u2019smedical decisions. But what I won\u2019t accept is extremists like Lauren Boebertand Fox News attacking my father and my sister. I am incredibly proud of myfather. He provided health care to women when they needed it during some ofthe happiest \u2013 and most devastating \u2013 moments of their lives. Beforeretirement, he would drive two hours to Planned Parenthood and help teach thenext generation of health care providers, like my sister. And no one \u2013 not FoxNews, and especially not extremists like Lauren Boebert or my new Republicanopponent \u2013 is going to stop my family from continuing to stand up for awoman\u2019s right to choose. We already scared off Lauren Boebert. In 2022, I camejust 546 votes shy of winning this House seat. I\u2019m ready to finish the job andreplace Boebert in Congress, but these are the kinds of ugly attacks that I\u2019mup against. Please, if you can afford to, will you give $5 or more right nowto my campaign to help me win this critical House seat? Our race was theclosest in the entire country in 2022. But I\u2019m not taking money from corporatePACs, so I\u2019m counting on grassroots donors like you if I\u2019m going to win.[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]Please use the links in this email to start a monthly donation throughActBlue: DONATE $10[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=10&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $25[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=25&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $35[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=35&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $50[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=50&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]DONATE $100[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&recurring;=true&amount;=100&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b]Other Amount[https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/frisch_email?refcode=em20241101am2-nd&amounts;=5%2C10%2C25%2C35%2C50%2C100%2C250&refcode2;=4b3a77f9-6198-ef11-88ce-000d3a98fa6b&recurring;=true]I knew this campaign was going to get nasty, but I never expected the otherside to go after my family.

But before we do, here\u2019s aquick rundown of where we are right now: 1. There are only 4 days left untilvoters go out to the polls. 2. 3. From the White House to down-ballot races,polls show that Democrats are in a dead heat to win the presidency and bothCongressional chambers. 4. 5. If Democrats win across the board, Kamala Harrisand Tim Walz will be able to effectively govern and bring all Americans on anew path forward. 6. 7. But if Trump and MAGA Republicans win, they\u2019ll doeverything they can to take our country backwards with their extremist Project2025 agenda. $4 may not seem like a lot, but if everyone reading this chippedin $4, we\u2019d be able to ensure Democrats have the resources to generate onelast momentum swing their way.

If you\u2019re way too online like me, you\u2019ve probably seen a tonof headlines about a bunch of rich guys running for Senate in states wherethey don't even live.

But this will be one ofthe toughest races of the year for Democrats. McCormick has millions uponmillions of dollars of his own to dump into this race, in addition to thebacking of Donald Trump and billionaire-funded super PACs. Pennsylvania is ascompetitive as it gets, and with the Senate majority and the White Housedepending on it, we can\u2019t take anything for granted.

Here's why: *Ohioans are already voting, and Election Day is next week \u2013 so the sooner wecan launch this final ad, the more voters we'll be able to reach before theysubmit their ballots. * We're getting drowned out on the airwaves \u2013Republicans have outspent us 3-to-1, so this final ad will punch back at theirattacks. * This final ad is going to be expensive \u2013 and we're going to run iton as many TV stations across Ohio as possible, so the more we raise, thebetter the chance we have at reaching the voters we need before Election Day.So, my team and I have set an urgent goal to raise $500,000 before midnighttomorrow to help launch this ad \u2013 my last ad before Election Day.

As the lead counsel in Trump\u2019s first impeachment in 2019, I saw first-hand that democratic ideals, values and institutions are perceived by Trump as an obstacle, not an asset. But I never imagined five years ago that he would go this far. And it is certain to get worse if he wins. Before I continue, please consider pitching in any amount in the final stretch of this election. Our vital work to defend our democracy and the rule of law is more important now than ever.

As lead counsel for the Democrats during Trump\u2019s first impeachment, I helped to expose Donald Trump and his lawlessness to the American people. We proved that a corrupt president had abused the power of his office to undermine our democratic process in a bid to stay in power. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dsg-em-nov24 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dsg-em-nov24] But that abuse of power was just the tip of the iceberg. Since then, Trump has attempted to overturn a lawful election in 2020, been indicted four times and convicted of 34 felony counts for interfering in the 2016 election, used his office to make money from foreign countries, cozied up to dictators, and tried everything in his power to undermine checks and balances and the separation of powers. But his plans for a second presidency are so much more dangerous. He has stated that he\u2019d like to be a dictator, that he will use the military and the Department of Justice against anyone who disagrees with him, that he will turn the federal government into his personal fiefdom, that he will take away our individual rights and personal freedoms, and that he will support dictators over democracies around the world. Peter, we have unfinished business to save our country from Trump\u2019s authoritarian intentions. Our democracy barely survived the first Trump presidency, and it\u2019s unlikely it would survive a second. I\u2019m running for re-election because we must stop Donald Trump and the Republican Party he controls from tearing down our democracy. And I need your support. Please contribute anything you can to support my work in the last four days of this election. We cannot waste a single second in this existential fight for American democracy.

You can contribute to multiple candidates with a single online transaction, and SCF will pay all expenses and processing fees. This will save these candidates a mountain of money, so they can use your contributions to win votes rather than to pay fundraising costs. Here are the Senate candidates who need your urgent support: \u2713 Bernie Moreno (OH) \u2713 Eric Hovde (WI) \u2713 Sam Brown (NV) \u2713 Kari Lake (AZ) Please take action right now by making a split contribution to their conservative Senate campaigns.

It's true. When you respond to marketing emails and text messages from candidates, the candidates often get less than 20 percent of your donation after expenses. That's why the Senate Conservatives Fund was founded \u2013 to give freedom-loving Americans an effective way to support the best Senate candidates across the nation. Please contribute to these four candidates today! We will combine your donations with those made by thousands of other patriots and transfer them directly to their campaigns.

In October of lastyear, Republicans in the state legislature manipulated the maps to gainunearned power. And state supreme court justices acted as ideologues insteadof neutral arbiters of the law \u2014 reversing the court\u2019s own very recentprecedent and allowing those maps to move forward. Shockingly, the currentgerrymandered maps allow Republicans to hold supermajorities in thelegislature even if Democrats win statewide elections. And it\u2019s important toremember that even if Democrats hold the governor\u2019s seat this year, aRepublican supermajority in the legislature can override his veto. You\u2019veprobably heard a lot about the governor\u2019s race in North Carolina thiselection, even if you don\u2019t live there. But here\u2019s the critical North Carolinarace not enough people are talking about: A state supreme court candidate hasopenly said he wants a Republican majority on the court for the upcomingredistricting cycle. He praised North Carolina\u2019s extreme congressionalgerrymander. And he joined a deeply controversial ruling that would haveestablished precedent for so-called personhood laws in North Carolina \u2014 thefoundation for restricting abortion and banning IVF. We are working to defeatcandidates like him in races across the country.

The user mentioned that it's the name of a committee in a disclaimer starting with 'Paid for by', but without including the address or treasurer's name. If there's no such committee, then 'None'. So I need to find any mention of 'Paid for by [Committee Name]'. Looking through the text, I see at the end: 'Pol. Ad paid for by Theresa4Texas.' That seems to fit, so 'committee' should be 'Theresa4Texas'. Next, the 'sender' key is about the author mentioned in the email. The text starts with 'Hi Friend,' and then later mentions 'Theresa' as sending the email, like 'Thanks for your help. Onwards, Theresa.' So the sender's name is Theresa. I should double-check to make sure there isn't another person named earlier, but it doesn't look like it.

I\u2019m fired up, Peter! The energy at President Trump\u2019s rally in Albuquerque today was palpable. I could feel it on stage while delivering my own remarks, and it was apparent to anyone who was there todaythat something special is happening in New Mexico. We\u2019re on the cusp of flipping this state red and electing new leadership that will secure our border, lower our cost of living, get tough on crime, improve education, and unleash our abundant natural resources. I need you to keep fighting every single day, every single moment, until the polls close on Tuesday. Our campaign is working 24/7 to reach remaining undecided voters and get out the vote. We need to keep resources flowing into this campaign to ensure our funding for these operations doesn\u2019t run dry. Your $5 or $10 contribution, in addition to your vote, is needed to help us secure more votes. Please chip in anything you can, and let\u2019s win this thing! Let's Flip New Mexico RED! Thank you, Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

A whopping 87% of ourfundraising comes from individual donations \u2013 NOT special interests likecorporate PACs. And we proved exactly how strong we are by outraising BrianFitzpatrick last quarter and setting a new record for Democratic fundraisingin PA-01. Ads The final case we're making to voters is Fitzpatrick's anti-choice record that has made women second-class citizens in this country.

But I thought alittle reminder would be helpful, especially contrasted with who Rick Scott is\ud83e\udd22. Maybe it will even motivate you to make your very first online donationbefore tonight's fundraising deadline to ensure I can defeat Rick Scott!https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2476-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 First and foremost, I'm everything I am todaybecause of my mother. She brought my sisters and me to America when I was just14. Mom knew we had to get out of Ecuador, which was transitioning todemocracy after suffering under a military dictatorship. She knew America wasthe key to a better life. Well, with a whole lot of hard work (includingworking in a doughnut shop to help my family get by), long hours, and a ton ofhope, we were able to win our American dream. My story is what inspires me togive back to this incredible country and state that gave me so much. Afterputting myself through college, I worked for several nonprofit organizationsacross Florida, helping to protect our wildlife and preserve our coral reefs.Rick Scott, on the other hand, banned saying the words \"climate change\" whenhe was governor of Florida, and the League of Conservation Voters gave him awhopping 0% score last year. During my time working at Florida InternationalUniversity, I spearheaded a new program to expand affordable health careaccess to more Floridians. But Rick Scott has voted to repeal the AffordableCare Act more times than I care to count. And who can forget he committed oneof the largest Medicare frauds in the history of our country. Eventually, Ihad the honor of serving my community in the U.S. House of Representatives,where I became the first South American immigrant to be elected to Congress!In the House, I wrote the bill to expand seniors\u2019 Medicare Advantage coverage,worked with Republicans to provide economic relief to families and smallbusinesses, and secured $200 million for Everglades restoration. I'm proud ofmy record \u2014 but can Rick Scott say the same, friend? He has used his time inoffice writing the plan to end Social Security and Medicare, attempting toundermine our elections, attacking our rights, and making it harder forworking families to get ahead. As a result, Rick Scott's approval ratings withFloridians are underwater. Even a large percentage of Republicans don'tapprove of him! Now, polling shows me statistically tied with Scott, and injust 4 days, we can defeat him and protect our Democratic Senate majority inthe process. But with Rick Scott outspending me 3-1 on the airwaves, it'sgoing to take a surge in grassroots support from people like you to trulydefeat him. So please, rush a donation of $5 or whatever you can to send me tothe U.S. Senate and give Floridians the true leader and public servant wedeserve!https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2476-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 -------- This email was sent todpwillis67@gmail.com.

She\u2019s said she\u2019s for more humanitarian relief now. She standsfor international human-rights laws, and she has the active support of membersof Congress who are insisting on the enforcement of international human-rightslaw. And she has publicly called out Rudy Giuliani\u2019s violent rhetoric aboutPalestinian children at Trump\u2019s racist Madison Square Garden rally. And as shesaid in her speech in Washington on Tuesday night, she will listen toeveryone, including people who disagree with her. I\u2019ve known her for years, soI know from personal experience that this is true. On the other hand, DonaldTrump, who put in place the illegal Muslim ban as president, has said he\u2019lllet Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cfinish the job.\u201d Donald Trump, whose own chief ofstaff says he is a fascist, has promised to deploy the military againstconstitutional protest and be a dictator on Day One. So if you care about thepeople of Gaza \u2014 and the right to protest about Gaza \u2014 you don\u2019t want DonaldTrump in power. Now I doubt any of you reading this email plan to vote forDonald Trump. But \u2014 and this is critical \u2014 if you sit this election out, or ifyou vote for a third-party candidate who will not win, you are letting DonaldTrump get one vote closer to power. Donald Trump in power will increasesuffering in Gaza and the world. If Kamala Harris is elected, we will havesomeone in the White House who will use the powers of the presidency toalleviate suffering at home and abroad, not increase it. Just as importantly,we will have someone in the White House with whom we can be in dialogue, notsomeone who will turn our country against us. Don\u2019t take only it from me.Senator Bernie Sanders supports Kamala Harris even though he stronglydisagrees with current Gaza policy, because he believes that Kamala in theWhite House is the best chance to change that policy. Hear more:https://x.com/berniesanders/status/1851040553745432775?s=42 Georgia State Rep.Ruwa Romman supports Kamala Harris for the same reason. Hear more:https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/ruwa-romman-harris-dnc-gaza-uncommitted-vote-1235144105/ Nada Elmikashfi of Wisconsin, a SudaneseAmerican and Muslim activist and political organizer who supports the peopleof Gaza, supports Kamala Harris because she believes that supporting Harris \u2014and not a third-party candidate \u2014 is the only way to keep Trump from makingeverything she cares about worse and harming far more communities than herown. Hear more: https://x.com/nadaelmikashfi/status/1851465420097585482?s=10And former President Jimmy Carter, who brokered the Camp David accords and hasworked tirelessly for more than 40 years for a comprehensive peace in theMiddle East that includes dignity, opportunity, and self-determination forPalestinians, supports Kamala Harris. I strongly encourage you to listen tothem. And finally, even as Gaza is first in many of our thoughts, even more isat stake in this election. Racial justice, abortion rights, climate change,and economic fairness: it\u2019s all on the ballot, along with the very soul ofthis country. Trump\u2019s racist Madison Square Garden rally leaves no more roomfor doubt about that. For the sake of all the people that would bear the bruntof Donald Trump\u2019s deliberate cruelty, and for the best chance of building abetter future for the people of Gaza, the Middle East, the United States, andthe world, I am asking you not to sit this out: I am asking for your vote forKamala Harris for President and Tim Walz for Vice President. - Keith Preparedand paid for by the Keith Ellison for Attorney General committee, PO Box17224, Minneapolis, MN 55417 Keith Ellison for Attorney General PO Box 17224Minneapolis, MN 55417 United States If you believe you received this messagein error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please unsubscribe:https://secure.ngpvan.com/p/rnmAh_BZp0CUaBw6XYl7Xw2?unsubscribedata=2W3VAJdw0Km2QlWjWSNn5jILNXUrlnEvliKA4k45I5pVyuqoBa4Y3UFm3BhbuqHtqqYrTIxbuJjziosllmOXfejlaoFG7D3AFDxJQG93VgilTx6DNsKdZMq%2FC2O3PQ%2F7BSpw91OasYmadv2hVJ%2F4elgiqlhVrEn8xl2lKfAyhd87jzDY6fFGwvfYWo7%2BOwui6dGaOsBEWAoyDu%2BaV7KBvNKX8hASP2M4qjbsfyGIzPQ7TxfTZTFaQgp3IYTwE9WBLAlxcSLEA5OK5pJjTWRqM6PnUTx%2B%2BQtqhSH6S%2B5v6nmHFpYEVkzLQ0tDTItkioUCjKTmQHt%2Bg9VoP1RJTtAVnAuUK8ObOKuEtRLoGf9z8Vv%2B9lwyIdQN0jkW8gZoR6D0H3taZ70cUxj55pabsOMrgUZPOCStGYjYt%2B55QwokiuMqRzJHxx8BVU5cxIFJ4Thh.",

Peter, I\u2019ve been crisscrossing the countryto do everything I can to help the team get across the finish line this fall.One of my most important stops: campaigning in Ohio with Bernie Moreno.President Trump and a Senate Republican majority will end the disastrousBiden-Harris agenda, but we cannot win a Senate majority without winning inOhio. Will you join me in supporting political outsider, Bernie Moreno?Bernie Moreno is the type of Senator we need in Washington. He\u2019s lived theAmerican dream - and wants to make sure our grandkids have the sameopportunities he had when he came to America at the age of five. He hasn\u2019tmade a career as a Washington insider - just the opposite. He\u2019s anentrepreneur who built a successful business from the ground up. ThisNovember, we\u2019ve got a great map\u2014unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in a fewdecades\u2014and with high-quality candidates like Bernie, I know we can win backthe Republican majority in the Senate. But here\u2019s the bad news, Peter.Democrats like Sherrod Brown are outraising us by millions. I\u2019ve alreadytransferred $4 million to help folks like Bernie, but he needs folks like youto step up to take on a 50-year career politician in Sherrod Brown. Even just$10 can make a difference when it comes to the millions Sherrod Brown israising from every liberal in the country. We have got to change the courseof this country and put an end to the dangerous Harris-Schumer-Brownagenda\u2014and that begins with doing everything we can to help Bernie Moreno winin Ohio and elect a Republican majority in the Senate! Thanks, John ThuneSenate Minority Whip Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Moreno fights for theAmerican Dream because he\u2019s lived it. Bernie was born in Bogota, Colombia. Atage five, his American Dream began when he moved to the United States with hisfamily. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18. Through his relentlesswork ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, he turned the first cardealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of the largest dealership groupsin America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value and transformationalpotential of blockchain technology, before it received mainstream attention,and moved much of his volunteer time and investment dollars into the space. In2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to be quite successful as Bernieserved as Chairman of the Board. After a long, successful career, Bernie soldmost of his business to begin focusing on his calling: protecting the Americandream for another generation. Solving our country\u2019s problems requires commonsense. In Washington, Bernie will fight to shrink government, protect ourfreedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party from taking our data and land, andalways put America First. Ohioans are done with politicians who talk a biggame and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. to get work done \u2013 just likehe always has.

He's everywhere Donald Trump goes. He infamously skipped animportant Senate vote to be Trump's lapdog in the courtroom for one of Trump'scriminal trials.Pathetic. Anyway, Donald Trump gave Rick Scott a very ...interesting shoutout: It's interesting how often Trump resorts to callingother people liars \u2014 when he himself is perhaps the most notorious serial liarin modern American history. It's no wonder he and Rick Scott get along sowell. Scott has lied time and again about his record of writing the plan toend Medicare and Social Security, about supporting a national abortion ban,and even about his Medicare fraud. Lies, lies, and more lies from the snakethat is Rick Scott and his buddy, the twice-impeached, disgraced liar of aformer president, Donald Trump. The TRUTH of the matter is that Donald Trumpand Rick Scott are scared of my new ad. They are scared because they know I'mstatistically tied with Scott in the polls as Floridians are beginning to casttheir ballots. They are scared we will pull off a massive political upset byflipping Florida blue.Well, Peter, they are right to be scared. We can winthis race and protect Democratic Senate control in the process, but it simplyis not possible if I don't hit my $10 million fundraising goal to fight RickScott's attack ads and reach every Florida voter. So please, rush a donationof $5 or whatever you can to help me hit my last fundraising deadline beforeElection Day, defeat Rick Scott, and protect our Democratic Senate majority!If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donationwill go through immediately: RUSH $25 IMMEDIATELY RUSH $50 IMMEDIATELY RUSH$100 IMMEDIATELY RUSH $250 IMMEDIATELY RUSH $500 IMMEDIATELY RUSH ANOTHERAMOUNT Thank you, Debbie DONATE Paid for by Defeat Boebert PAC This emailwas sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com .

I had some things on my mind I needed to share with you. I never envisioned myself running for Congress. It wasn't part of the plan. But over the past 5 years \u2014 since Trump made that phone call attempting to extort Ukraine \u2014 the Republican party has shown the dangerous path they are willing to tread. And we have seen firsthand the threat that extremism poses to our democracy. So I launched this campaign because I needed to do something \u2014 I needed to continue defending our democracy in whatever capacity I could. Because our children and families deserve better than the extremists we have now in Congress, controlling the People\u2019s House. I\u2019ve only gotten this far with pure grassroots support. Support from folks like you. And I can only pass the finish line with you by my side. With only four days to go until the most critical election of our lifetimes, I am asking: Can you please split $10 between my campaign for Congress and Jason Crow's today? That\u2019s it. Just $10. Because when you and everyone reading this email give $10, we will have the power to defeat our MAGA extremist opponent at the polls in four days and flip the House majority blue.

I really want you to see the whole thing. Please check this out! WATCH PRES. TRUMP\u2019S NM REMARKS \u00bb \u2014Nella Domenici ABOUT NELLA New Mexico is Nella Domenici\u2019s home. She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

This week, we learned that hasn\u2019t been the case for myopponent, Joe McGraw. From WIFR: \u201cThe Illinois State Board of Electionsconfirmed the former 17th Judicial Circuit judge wasn\u2019t a resident of the areahe would represent if elected on Nov. 5.\u201d As someone representing my hometown,I\u2019m definitely doing so with a heightened sense of duty. That\u2019s what decadesof building relationships and absorbing local values will do to you, and it\u2019swhy I always felt a deep sense of responsibility as a meteorologist -- helpingmy community understand the risks and make well-informed decisions. So maybethat\u2019s why WBEZ reported that McGraw has been \u201crepeating Trump campaigntalking points\u201d on the trail instead of representing what\u2019s popular in thedistrict \u2013 he\u2019s not going to be fighting for us, but for his MAGA mega-donorshoping to flip this seat. We need support to make sure our voices come first,not MAGA. If you can, please chip in $10 to keep our momentum going. Let\u2019s re-elect someone focused on IL-17 first.

As we entered the final week before Election Day, Melissa Chaudhry issued a public statement calling on Adam Smith to take his own advice to Joe Biden, and step aside. Shockingly, the police were called on us as we were peacefully gathered outside Smith's federal office - paid for by our tax money, and legally required to be accessible to the public! Yet another example of Adam Smith violating fundamental American freedoms of speech and assembly - which, we'll recall, is why he was formally Condemned and Censured by the 43rd LD Democrats, earlier this year! Please watch the video below, and please forward to your friends and family. Whether they've already voted or not, everyone needs to know who Smith is, what he's done, and why we need to vote him out. In these final days, please do everything you can to help get the word out! Join us to canvass or sign-wave - events listed on the website here! Give the campaign a Like, Comment, Follow, and Share on social media - and make your own posts sharing why you're a supporter! Get in touch with your friends and family and let them know why they should vote for Melissa. Chip in financially to help strengthen the campaign in this final push! Remember, Melissa's campaign is ENTIRELY supported by individuals - not foreign interests, corporate PACs, or war profiteers! Why? Because she believes government should truly be Of, By, and For the People - and serve and uphold Liberty and Justice for ALL. Let's make history together and elect Melissa to Congress!

This race is wayyyyy too close for comfort! The Senatemajority will come down to Montana, so I need you to GET OFF YOUR YOU-KNOW-WHAT and help keep Jon Tester in the Senate. Jon told me that a generous groupof donors stepped up to match all grassroots contributions and help him closethe gap, but he\u2019s STILL falling behind. WTF?

For American Greatness!Bernie Moreno GOP Nominee for Senate, Ohio Meet Bernie Moreno: Bernie Morenofights for the American Dream because he\u2019s lived it. Bernie was born inBogota, Colombia. At age five, his American Dream began when he moved to theUnited States with his family. Bernie became an American citizen at age 18.Through his relentless work ethic and untamable entrepreneurial spirit, heturned the first car dealership that he purchased in 2005 into one of thelargest dealership groups in America. In 2016, Bernie recognized the value andtransformational potential of blockchain technology, before it receivedmainstream attention, and moved much of his volunteer time and investmentdollars into the space. In 2018 he co-founded ChampTitles, which grew to bequite successful as Bernie served as Chairman of the Board. After a long,successful career, Bernie sold most of his business to begin focusing on hiscalling: protecting the American dream for another generation. Solving ourcountry\u2019s problems requires common sense. In Washington, Bernie will fight toshrink government, protect our freedoms, stop the Chinese Communist party fromtaking our data and land, and always put America First. Ohioans are done withpoliticians who talk a big game and do nothing. Bernie wants to go to D.C. toget work done \u2013 just like he always has.

So I\u2019m asking one more time:Please, make a TRIPLE MATCHED gift to LCV Victory Fund to help us get out thevote in this final weekend >>https://links.messages.lcv.org/els/v2/G8bxcKGWwPBL/Vi8xQ3VuY0RpaVRIYWlnTVR0SzNKS2tNVm1nMmdsUWlrTk1OT0JMWVYwekRLandpM2M4WDF3TnE1Q01pREJ6R05vaWhUSG92VDVJQnpuOFJTMHBYaTJLUkpCM3BmeTQrM3NnNm5BVlVkbm89S0/ZktvNFdMeWtOdHJvajdQWjFWcVFuRkFuMVBHKysyWWtwTmRYQzVoOHdSdUxzTXJrOG95TG50SUk5YmluZXN5UWlYbmpEZ3hPYUVCMTEwa2RpTDlkU21mZjh3NGhxZEdLYy9RVGUvY3RuQ2RDMG80ZEZYR2NsQ0o0RWRqbE54RDFDWTluQXI3Um9zWT0S1MAKE YOUR 3X GIFT >>https://links.messages.lcv.org/els/v2/ambdF6dXPLtD/Vi8xQ3VuY0RpaVRIYWlnTVR0SzNKS2tNVm1nMmdsUWlrTk1OT0JMWVYwekRLandpM2M4WDF3TnE1Q01pREJ6R05vaWhUSG92VDVJQnpuOFJTMHBYaTJLUkpCM3BmeTQrM3NnNm5BVlVkbm89S0/ZktvNFdMeWtOdHJvajdQWjFWcVFuRkFuMVBHKysyWWtwTmRYQzVoOHdSdUxzTXJrOG95TG50SUk5YmluZXN5UWlYbmpEZ3hPYUVCMTEwa2RpTDlkU21mZjh3NGhxZEdLYy9RVGUvY3RuQ2RDMG80ZEZYR2NsQ0o0RWRqbE54RDFDWTluQXI3Um9zWT0S1I\u2019m really hoping I can report back to our organizers just how many people areout there cheering them on \u2014 so please, even if it\u2019s just $5, every bit helps.Here\u2019s an example of the conversations our canvassers are having on the groundin swing states: One of our organizers in Michigan just told us about a voterwho had heard wild lies about how Kamala Harris had been locking up Black menfor marijuana infractions.

Without your support, we would not havegotten to where we are today. Your support, whether you joined my team at thestart of my campaign or in the past few weeks has not gone unnoticed. Whetherit's helping us fill up the campaign car with gas, funding our get out thevote efforts, or helping us keep ads on the air, your support has gone a longway.https://click.email.judgejoeforcongress.com/?qs=cf86390fc711a73d9a69ac7229b8a224e52a9daeabcf5db72953679b7137a8fb9d31d2c2327f7d2b9138b7baa0003f917c61d15d277288e9c812d42b78957806Now, with just 4 days left to go, we're in the final stretch.

I want totell you more about why I\u2019m so excited to support these candidates, but first,can you chip in $20 to split a contribution for these candidates ahead ofElection Day?[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/pccc_2024_house_janefonda?refcode=email_110124_kmr-fonda-split] I\u2019m excited to team up with the PCCC to support a slate ofincredible climate candidates running in competitive congressional races whoare committed to tackling the climate crisis, including standing up topowerful special interests like the fossil fuel industry. These candidatesneed our help: * Kristen McDonald Rivet is running to flip Michigan\u2019s 8thCongressional District . In the state senate, Kristen helped pass ambitiousclean energy legislation to address the climate crisis, create clean jobs, andsave Michiganders money. She also secured funding to replace lead pipes andensure kids have clean drinking water at schools. * Dave Min is running forCalifornia\u2019s 47th Congressional District . As a state senator, Dave chairedthe Natural Resources and Water Committee and introduced legislation toterminate offshore oil and gas leases and secured funding to improve beaches.* Andrea Salinas is running for re-election in Oregon\u2019s 6th CongressionalDistrict . In Congress Andrea has been a tireless champion for our environmentand the well-being of the entire Pacific Northwest. She\u2019s fighting for a cleanenergy future for her daughter and all Americans. In 2022 Andrea won by lessthan three points, so it\u2019s critical we defend her seat this year. Corporatespecial interests and far-right extremists are pouring millions into theseraces to defeat these progressive climate champions. For the sake of ourenvironment and electing a pro-environment Congress, we must have their backs.Can you help us ensure these climate champions have the resources they need towin?

Did you see the final race ratings from the Cook Political Report? Cook Political is a premier election forecaster that identifies the most competitive swing seats nationwide. And they\u2019ve determined that California has more competitive tossup seats than any other state in the country. Next Tuesday, control of the U.S. House is going to come down to us. Let\u2019s not leave anything on the field. Please, will you pitch in a donation of $ or more right now?

If we don\u2019t flip these seats, Democrats have no chance of taking back our House Majority. That means another two years of Speaker Johnson who will do everything in his power to obstruct a President Harris or enable a dangerous President Donald Trump. We have the power to fire Speaker Johnson and take back the House of Representatives.

November 5th isdays away, and I\u2019d really appreciate the chance toexplain why this request \u2014 especially today \u2014 is so critically important.Here\u2019s the truth: Right now, we have a week of media buys to pay for \u2014 themost important week of the entire campaign. And if we don\u2019t raise what we neednow, we will be forced to give up the airwaves and let Adam Schiff and theDemocrat-machine backing him up run their attacks on me unopposed. Whatmatters most right now is that we do whatever we can to fund a campaign thatcan win. That\u2019s the most important thing. Winning this race. Not just for thesake of winning, but because of what it would mean to substitute my presencewith Adam Schiff\u2019s in the Senate. That\u2019s a reality I don\u2019t think any of uswant to consider, but it\u2019s what will happen if we come up short. Now, time isrunning out.

And if they succeed with their plans, regular, everydayAmericans will pay the price.

Dave McCormick, a fellow Armyveteran, is running in Pennsylvania against Bob Casey. Sam Brown, anotherfellow Army veteran, is running in Nevada against Jacky Rosen. Bernie Moreno,a proven business leader, is running in Ohio against Sherrod Brown. And KariLake, a tough conservative who will put America first, is running in Arizona.SPLIT A DONATION HERE If these tough conservatives win, it guaranteesRepublicans win the U.S. Senate. And I need each of them there with me to stopthe Marxist Left in its tracks, and to make America strong again. A donationof any amount will go directly to their campaigns, and *any amount* will makea difference ahead of this critical marker. As I\u2019ve also said before, if wedon\u2019t win in November, we\u2019re done.

President Trump's unwavering resolve had my back, and together, wesent a message to the world:America will not be swayed by tyranny.

Everything is OK, it'sjust that I'm a bundle of nerves and excitement in these final days of thecampaign, where we are so close to actually defeating Rick Scott andprotecting Democratic control of the Senate! I need you to know that we neverwould have gotten to a point where the polls are statistically tied, wherebrand new polling data has me leading by 18 points with independent voters,where Rick Scott is forced to spend tens of millions of dollars to competewith our grassroots movement, and where the major Democratic committees spendmillions of dollars of their own money to help us because they believe in us!Thank you, friend. A year ago at this time, the political pundits wrote offFlorida completely. We put Florida in play. We gave Rick Scott his notice. Weare on the cusp of pulling off the greatest political upset in modern history.But Rick Scott is outspending me nearly 3-to-1 on the airwaves \u2014 and he'salready spent over $38 million on ads to defeat me. Well, I don't have afraudulently earned fortune like him to tap into. I have you, friend. I havethis grassroots movement. And I can only fight back and win by closing in onmy final $4 million goal before Election Day. So please, will you make adonation of $5 or more to help me make history here in Florida? Whatever yougive will be put to work immediately to counter Rick Scott's attack ads,defeat him once and for all, and save our Democratic Senate majority!https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk2478-fr-text Well, there's another cup of coffee gone \u2615\ufe0f.

I\u2019m notalone. Every single Republican Senator and Senate candidate is facing thisfinal deadline. And for our nominees in battleground states, it could be amake or break moment. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you to split a donation betweenthese candidates and my campaign ASAP. Tim Sheehy, who served as a Navy Seal,<> is running in Montana against Jon Tester. Dave McCormick, a fellow Armyveteran, is running in Pennsylvania against Bob Casey. Sam Brown, anotherfellow Army veteran, is running in Nevada against Jacky Rosen. Bernie Moreno,a proven business leader, is running in Ohio against Sherrod Brown. And KariLake, a tough conservative who will put America first, is running in Arizona.SPLIT A DONATION HERE If these tough conservatives win, it guaranteesRepublicans win the U.S. Senate. And I need each of them there with me to stopthe Marxist Left in its tracks, and to make America strong again. A donationof any amount will go directly to their campaigns, and *any amount* will makea difference ahead of this critical marker. As I\u2019ve also said before, if wedon\u2019t win in November, we\u2019re done. So, if you can give at this time, don\u2019twait.Help each of these tough conservatives before this final deadline, andlet\u2019s win in 4 days. In service, Tom Cotton DONATE NOW Paid for by theNRSC.

President Trump's unwavering resolve had my back, and together, wesent a message to the world:America will not be swayed by tyranny.

Common sense gun laws. Climate action.That\u2019s why we built this state-by-state strategy. Our grassroots team ishelping get out the vote and showing folks just what\u2019s at stake in thesestates like these: * Pennsylvania is the only state in the country with adivided legislature \u2014 Democrats hold the state house and Republicans the statesenate. Both chambers are toss-ups, and whether pro-democracy candidates areelected could decide whether we have a path to redistricting reform. * InArizona we\u2019re mobilizing against a ballot initiative that would essentiallyend term limits for state supreme court and appellate court judges \u2014 includingthose already serving. * Michigan voters passed a ballot initiative to createa fair redistricting process. But extremists are trying to take back the statehouse \u2014 and if they win, they could plan harmful changes to the state\u2019sindependent redistricting commission. This is a movement of millions ofAmericans, across all 50 states, committed to making our elected officialsmore responsive to the people they represent. Every dollar you give helpsbuild our momentum in key states when it matters most.

As the formerDirector of the CIA, I've stared down evil before, and I know that weakness isits fuel. President Trump's unwavering resolve had my back, and together, wesent a message to the world:America will not be swayed by tyranny.

According to several recent reports, Tim Sheehy lied about his military service. 1. On the campaign trail, Sheehy claimed he had a gunshot wound in his arm from combat. But according to the New York Times, public records, and firsthand accounts\u2014including a Navy SEAL who served with Sheehy\u2014his gunshot wound was from accidentally shooting himself in the arm in Glacier National Park. 2. Days later, NBC News released another bombshell report stating Sheehy lied about being \u201cmedically discharged\u201d from the Navy. It\u2019s shocking\u2014and Montanans must know the truth but we\u2019re running out of time. So I made the difficult decision to launch more television and digital ads today. The money isn\u2019t in the budget yet\u2014but with polls in the margin of error, running these final ads could be enough to break the tie in Jon\u2019s favor and win this race. I need you to split an immediate donation to help us fund these last-minute ads. How you respond right now could be the difference between winning and losing. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_tester?refcode=jtk5618-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Every time I take a risk on this campaign, it\u2019s because I believe in this team. I\u2019m confident grassroots supporters like you\u2014who\u2019ve stepped up time and time again\u2014will help us win this Senate race.

        "body": "It's plain to see, friend: Rick Scott is TERRIFIED of our movement \u2014 and hehas every reason to be: Based on his all-time-low approval rating at 35%, andKamala Harris now polling within the margin of error against Trump in Florida,it's clear that Florida voters are sick and tired of both the right-wingmovement and its most loyal puppets, like Scott. And it's no coincidence \u2014since his election in 2018, Rick Scott's been nothing more than a rubber stampfor anything and everything Donald Trump wants: * Trump's SCOTUS nominees *Trump's dangerous agenda * Trump's baseless voter fraud claims * Trump'srefusal to certify Biden's victory * Rubber stamp after rubber stamp afterrubber stamp If both Trump and Scott are reelected in November, they couldconspire to move the Supreme Court even further to the right. Scott could bein charge of the Senate as majority leader, and with Trump unchecked by anycriminal culpability for his official acts as president, they could unleashthe most dangerous, extremist agenda yet on the American people. I refuse tolet that happen. Listen, nothing less than our democracy is at stake when itcomes to defeating Rick \"Rubber Stamp\" Scott this November. But just as he didlast time around, Scott is already shelling out millions from his own personalfortune to buy this Senate seat. He's already spent over $38 million on ads todefeat me as polling shows us in a statistical dead heat! Rick Scott isscared, plain and simple. And he should be. He's one of the most vulnerableGOP senators on the ballot, and with your grassroots support, we will defeathim. But I'm still falling short of my LAST $4 MILLION fundraising goal \u2014 agoal we MUST hit by Nov. 5. So please, will you help me close this fundraisinggap and fight back by rushing a donation of $5 or more? We can and must defeatRick Scott and Donald Trump, and it's YOUR donation that will make itpossible. Please, chip in right now. >>>https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2479-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you, Debbie -------- This email was sentto dpwillis67@gmail.com.

I wanted to send you a quick message while I have my morning coffee. To be honest, asking for donations is my least favorite part of the job. But the truth is it\u2019s absolutely necessary if we\u2019re going to keep Wisconsin blue and defend this seat. Republicans have spent $100 million on ads attacking me and uplifting my opponent. The bad news is, their strategy seems to be working \u2014 with multiple polls showing my opponent taking a one-point lead. Losing this seat would cost Democrats control of the Senate. If Eric Hovde secured the majority for Mitch McConnell and the extreme GOP, everything from the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights to Social Security and Medicare would be on the chopping block. We can\u2019t let that happen, but we\u2019re running out of time to stop them. We have three days left to leave it all on the field \u2014 get our message in front of the final undecided Wisconinites, turn out voters across the state, and win this toss-up race.

        "All right, so I need to process this disclaimer text and extract specific information. Let me start by reading through the entire text carefully to understand its content and identify the key sections relevant to the task.": "Hmm, the text is about a political fundraising effort for Senate Conservatives Fund. It mentions Mitch McConnell stepping down and the importance of supporting conservative candidates through donations. There's also a list of specific candidates who need support.",
        "I notice that there's a 'PAID FOR BY' line at the end: 'Paid For By SENATE CONSERVATIVES FUND AND NOT AUTHORIZED BY ANY CANDIDATE OR CANDIDATE'S COMMITTEE.' So, this is the part that starts with 'Paid for by...' but doesn't include the committee name or address or treasurer's name. It just mentions the fund.": "Okay, so the committee in question here would be 'SENATE CONSERVATIVES FUND' as it begins with 'Paid For By' but doesn't list a specific committee address or treasurer's details. Therefore, the 'committee' key should be set to 'SENATE CONSERVATIVES FUND'.",
        "Now, looking for the sender's name. The text is an email or promotional material, and usually such disclaimers end with who paid for it. After that, there might be information about how to unsubscribe or contact them. However, in this case, after 'PAID FOR BY', it lists the fund and not a person.": "Wait, let me check again. The text ends with 'Unsubscribe' but doesn't specify a sender's name. It seems like the disclaimer is from an organization, not an individual. So, there might not be a specific sender mentioned here. If that's the case, the 'sender' key should be None.",
        "Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with 'committee' as 'SENATE CONSERVATIVES FUND' and 'sender' as null or None since no individual sender is specified.": "But just to be thorough, did I miss any part where a person's name is mentioned? Scanning through, I see mentions of Mitch McConnell, but he's stepping down. The rest are candidate names like Bernie Moreno, Eric Hovde, etc., but those aren't senders in the disclaimer text. So, no sender is present here.",
        "So, my final JSON should reflect that the committee is 'SENATE CONSERVATIVES FUND' and there's no sender mentioned.": "I think that covers everything. Now I'll format it correctly as per the instructions without any additional comments or explanations.",

Roy is term-limited and can\u2019t run again this time, and our upcoming gubernatorial election is considered the most consequential gubernatorial contest in the country.

Not just because he\u2019s a member of Congress, or because he served as an impeachment manager in the case against Donald Trump, or on the January 6th Committee \u2014 though I am proud of him for all of those things! I admire my dad because he is tireless and relentless in his work to make a difference for others \u2014 especially young people like me and my brother Eli. Whether he\u2019s fighting to reform the Supreme Court so my generation is not beholden to an ultra-conservative judiciary, or fighting to cancel student loan debt, or fighting to restore reproductive rights, or fighting to protect our clean air and water, he\u2019s taking on big fights to help other people out. My dad is one of the most selfless people I know. Growing up, I would watch him at campaign events, asking people over and over again how he could help and hearing about their struggles. For most people, it would probably be exhausting and quite challenging \u2014 especially when the former president of the United States is always demonizing you. But my dad has never wavered in his work to make real change. For your grandma, your neighbor down the street who is a veteran, your teacher, your kids and grandkids, for everyone. And that\u2019s why I know he\u2019s going to be a damn good Senator.

This time he raised over$1.2 million in the first two weeks of October alone, no doubt boosted byTrump\u2019s attacks on me as the \u201cenemy within.\u201d This is a MAJOR problem. We onlyhave a handful of days left to make up the difference in our fundraising. CanI count on you to rush in a split contribution of $10 between Fight for Reformto elect state and local Democrats and my campaign before midnight to help usclose the gap? \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56596?t=1003&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggIf you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your splitdonation between Fight for Reform and Adam Schiff will go through immediately:CONTRIBUTE $10 \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56597?t=1004&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggCONTRIBUTE $25 \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56598?t=1005&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggCONTRIBUTE $50 \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56599?t=1006&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggCONTRIBUTE $100 \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56600?t=1007&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggOr a custom donation \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56596?t=1008&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggGarvey has now raised over $18 million during this campaign. Every day we letpass without responding to Garvey\u2019s fundraising numbers is another opportunityfor him to reach undecided voters in the California Senate race \u2014 and moreMAGA candidates to press their advantage down-ballot. The implications gobeyond just our race: If Garvey turns out GOP voters, we are putting injeopardy the half-dozen toss-up House races in California that could determinethe House majority. We can\u2019t count out Republican candidates in California. Wesimply can\u2019t. Steve Garvey has outraised our campaign over the last threefundraising reporting periods. But we still have time to beat him right now,when it matters most. That\u2019s why I\u2019m urgently asking: Can you pitch in a splitdonation of $10 or any amount between Fight for Reform to elect state andlocal Democrats and my campaign to help us shift the momentum back in ourfavor? Steve Garvey outraised us by over $330,000, and any amount you givewill help us catch up. \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56596?t=1009&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggIf you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your splitdonation between Fight for Reform and Adam Schiff will go through immediately:CONTRIBUTE $10 \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56597?t=1010&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggCONTRIBUTE $25 \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56598?t=1011&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggCONTRIBUTE $50 \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56599?t=1012&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggCONTRIBUTE $100 \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56600?t=1013&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggOr a custom donation \u00bbhttps://act.fightforreform.org/go/56596?t=1014&akid;=22489%2E4449941%2Ej_qnggThank you.

We all ran in and out of each other\u2019s houses, everyone\u2019sparents took care of everyone. It was a magical place to live. Like so manyfamilies, mine lived paycheck-to-paycheck \u2014 and when my littlest sister wasborn with a heart condition, we were bankrupted by medical bills. Our familygot by thanks to the generosity of our community \u2014 most people had no moremoney than we did, but helped us anyway. Our neighbors and friends took therest of us kids into their homes while my parents were with my sister at thehospital over 100 miles away. And when we were all home together, they broughtmore meals by the house than we could ever hope to eat. Their support helpedme go to college, and after that I joined the Marines to honor everything ourcommunity did for me and my family growing up. But when I came home betweentours in Iraq and Afghanistan, I found that old magical place picked for parts\u2014 our local corner store was boarded up, our family\u2019s first home in theneighborhood was bulldozed to the ground.

Following the diagnosis, Doctors warned that continuing the pregnancywould endanger Allie\u2019s life. But, the Tennessee state legislature, which is85% male, had passed a near-total ban on abortion in 2022. She was forced toleave her home state, devastated and heartbroken, to obtain the life-savingcare she needed: \u201cWith a risk of sepsis, blood clots, or more, I underwent anemergency abortion. I did this alone: in a city I had never been to before,without my family or my husband there by my side,\u201d Allie said. After thishorrible, tragic experience, Allie began advocating for a new policy shetitled \u201cMiley\u2019s Law,\u201d which would add an exception for fetal anomalies to herstate\u2019s abortion ban. However, her legislator, Rep. Jeff Burkhart, did nothave any empathy for her experience. He told her that if his own daughter hadbeen in her position, he\u2019d have wanted her to continue the pregnancy\u2026 he alsotold her \u201cmost of the time the pregnancies that go bad are usually the firstpregnancy.\u201d (???) It\u2019s way past time we elect legislators, not mansplainerswho have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. Betches News recently publishedthe audio from that conversation, \u201cIn recently unearthed audio from June 2023,Republican Tennessee representative Jeff Burkhart is heard speaking to twowomen who had lost pregnancies. In the conversation he actively tried toinvalidate their experiences because of his own misinformed understanding ofreproductive health. Almost a year earlier, a ban on abortion from the pointof conception with zero exceptions went into effect in Tennessee.\u201d After theconversation, Phillips wrote to Buckhart and said, \u201cEvery chance I get to tellmy story, I will\u2026 Who knows, maybe one day I\u2019ll run against you.\u201d Now Allie isrunning for HIS SEAT in the TN House of Representatives \u2013 and she is withinstriking distance of actually winning it \u2013 but she needs our help.

I'm talking about DemocratDebbie Mucarsel-Powell's campaign to defeat Rick Scott in Florida and protectour Democratic Senate majority. Just recently, Debbie narrowed the polling gapbetween her and Rick Scott to just 2 points. Then the experts at InsideElections increased her chances of defeating Rick Scott. So what's next,friend? Well, with your immediate grassroots donation, Debbie wins. That iswhat's next.

From supporting the farm worker movement withCesar Chavez in California to campaigning for Ted Kennedy's presidentialcampaign in Florida (yes, Florida!) to supporting Democratic Senatecandidates, I've never been shy about getting involved and fighting for what'sright. Fighting for what's right most usually demands articulating what iswrong. And Florida's GOP senator Rick Scott \u2014 who is beholden to Donald Trump\u2014 is absolutely wrong for Florida and our nation. A Republican majority in theSenate, with Donald Trump in the White House, is downright wrong and dangerousfor our nation. You know it as well as I do. Trump and Scott are beholden toan extreme ideology that attacks the heart of our nation \u2014 our freedom anddemocracy \u2014 while empowering and enriching themselves and their allies. Theiragenda wouldn't just send our nation backward, but it would also cause untoldharm. That's why I'm all in to help Debbie Mucarsel-Powell win in Florida. Ifwe win in Florida, Democrats hold the Senate. If we win in Florida, we stopDonald Trump. If we win in Florida, the \"what's next?\" is building a countrywith new, hopeful ideas and possibilities. So please join me by rushing adonation of $5 right now to help Debbie Mucarsel-Powell defeat Rick Scott.She's up against millions of dollars of attack ads courtesy of Scott and hisGOP allies, and Debbie can only fight back and win with your immediatesupport.https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2480-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you, Martin Sheen -------- This email wassent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

A reckoning is approaching. Hey friends - this is JohnRich. I'm proud to be a thorn in the side of the woke Left. Here's the thing.I've been singing and writing country music since before the word \"woke\" waseven a thing. I grew up in the South and was raised to be a freedom-lovingpatriot who always stands for the flag, protects the Second Amendment,supports our troops, and backs the blue. And that's why it makes me absolutelysick to see what the liberal whack jobs have done to our country, and whatthey have in store for our future. They want to redefine what it means to bean American. They won't stop until \"one nation under God\" is stripped from ourPledge of Allegiance. They are eager to parade drag queens through ourchildren's classrooms. They won't sleep until the U.S. Constitution isshredded to bits. It's an utter disgrace, but I find peace knowing that \"theLord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.\" It also doesn'thurt that we have patriots like Senator Marsha Blackburn fighting the goodfight for us in the U.S. Senate.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=b92d85a9778a6af9c4d56fbab9155cfbad4f420c998df4df1d983c9fb236ba284331617beb4f8d638e6d3edcdcdcf96facaf909453f9fd8d708adbf2184b5a4fThat's actually why I'm emailing you today. Chuck Schumer and his socialistcronies in Washington are propping up radical socialists to destroy MarshaBlackburn and PERMANENTLY take over Tennessee. They will spend, lie, and cheattheir way to victory unless we do something about it right here and now. Weneed a response that will leave Marsha's opponents regretting they everentered the ring.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=b92d85a9778a6af9c4d56fbab9155cfbad4f420c998df4df1d983c9fb236ba284331617beb4f8d638e6d3edcdcdcf96facaf909453f9fd8d708adbf2184b5a4fSo, I'm directly asking you to join me in supporting her campaign. SenatorMarsha Blackburn is as tough as they come. She's never given an inch to thewoke mob, and she is a God-fearing patriot like you and me. Marsha has mycomplete backing, and I hope you're willing to give her the same. I don'twrite emails like this ever, so trust me when I tell you that Marsha Blackburnneeds your support today to defeat her opponents and all the commie lovingLiberals hell-bent on destroying America. If they take Tennessee, the battleis over. We'd never recover.https://click.updates.marshablackburn.com/?qs=b92d85a9778a6af9c4d56fbab9155cfbad4f420c998df4df1d983c9fb236ba284331617beb4f8d638e6d3edcdcdcf96facaf909453f9fd8d708adbf2184b5a4fI'm asking this as a personal favor to a fellow Patriot: please don't closethis email without taking a moment to support Marsha Blackburn's campaign.

We\u2019ve been out on the Campaigntrail for almost a year and now it is time to take action at the ballot box.We need your support so please get out and vote. We are three days from theMain Event - For us it is a David v. Goliath story. We have been identifyingand posing solutions to issues facing the citizens of this district and willcontinue to do so and we have been working with the local candidates OurCampaign has been one about Federal Solutions to Local Problems that you and Iface living in the Constitution State of Connecticut. We have also looked atworld issues and issues that need to be addressed in Congress especially onglobal energy and reduced global emissions (See Article [https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/40db40d4-519f-4190-ae65-7e32a8d5227b?j=eyJ1IjoiMWh2cjYwIn0.VBabVq-VHATXCJqsddI7uMpdiTm0WkVanRDZfvCWMkg ]). We\u2019ve been out there: knocking doors,talking to people at Garbage dumps (long before we were called garbage),talking to you, marching in parades, talking to our youth, our veterans,talking to communities that have been ignored. We have also spent a lot oftime talking to people in the supermarkets about their pocketbook issues. Wehave a pretty good feeling of the pulse of this State and this Country. Hereare some of the issues that matter to Every Day Nutmeggers like You.Connecticut has a border crisis. Immigration and bad economic policy isaffecting everyone and causes rampant inflation. The fentanyl and traffickingmaking its way to our backyard must stop. At the grocery stores, many peopleare waiting to shop on sale days and many are shopping at multiplesupermarkets to take advantages of different sales. The sales price ofgroceries today were the regular prices under the Trump administration. Thereis no price gouging at supermarkets as they typically run on less than a 2%profit margin and high volume. They are struggling due to high energy costs,supply chain issues, and theft. Crime is rampant and our police need to besupported and this mantra of Crime Pays Under Harris and Himes needs to bereversed. Education - Parents want to be able to send their children wherethey want and we have been advocating for school choice. When we marched thePuerto Rican Day parade, so many parents expressed the challenges of workingtwo or three jobs to be in a position to send their children to private orparochial schools because Bridgeport ranks at the bottom of the schooldistricts of 161 out of about 165. (See our article on Your Child, YourChoice. [ https://open.substack.com/pub/drmichaelgoldstein4ct/p/your-child-your-choice?r=26c3ku&utm;_campaign=post&utm;_medium=web ]) Housing is anothermajor issue and not just 8-30g. Rents keep going up and the supply of housingis an issue in some parts of our district. Pricing is going up forinflationary reasons as cost of home heating is up. Cost of electricity is up.Cost of insurance is up. Hartford keeps jamming 8\u201330g down our throats. Thismandate does not solve the real problem, which is enough affordable ownershipof housing. Our children cannot afford to live in Fairfield County. (See ourarticle on housing [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/dccf95aa-daad-4ffa-adbd-7d8603409ab6?j=eyJ1IjoiMWh2cjYwIn0.VBabVq-VHATXCJqsddI7uMpdiTm0WkVanRDZfvCWMkg ]). We Need a Return to Local Control andAffordable Home Ownership and Building Equity. Medicare - We are seeingSeniors on fixed income getting the shock of their lives as Medicare fundswere diverted - Only $280 Billion - to subsidize the Green New Deal of theInflation Reduction Act. This will cause major issues and we have to take careof our seniors [https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/4235c566-f55f-4198-963b-355b89783a8f?j=eyJ1IjoiMWh2cjYwIn0.VBabVq-VHATXCJqsddI7uMpdiTm0WkVanRDZfvCWMkg ]. Business - Companies are moving out ofConnecticut. The only companies that come here are doing so because they haveto. When they get here, they are stuck in traffic because I-95 doesn\u2019t move -You can blame Himes for that one - See our article - When you Are Stuck onI-95 - Blame Himes) [https://open.substack.com/pub/drmichaelgoldstein4ct/p/i-95-when-you-are-in-traffic-blame?r=26c3ku&utm;_campaign=post&utm;_medium=web ]. Thisinfrastructure and energy crisis is causing issues to Commercial Real EstateConcerns and we need to bring more jobs to Connecticut with new pro-businessstrategies including: reduced regulatory burdens, expedited zoning and permitapprovals, improving the infrastructure with less congested highways andimproved commuter rail service. Federal tax incentives and opportunity zonesare tools that can be used to attract new businesses to our beautiful state.These are techniques being used by other states to lure away Connecticutbusinesses. We need to be more aggressive in both attracting and keepingbusinesses here. (See our Article on Addressing our Commercial Markets [https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/6daa23f1-9e4e-44d9-8658-35fbc3680cff?j=eyJ1IjoiMWh2cjYwIn0.VBabVq-VHATXCJqsddI7uMpdiTm0WkVanRDZfvCWMkg ]). I-95 - It needs solutions and somework is being done. Our new concern is that the roads are being improved bycontractors not from Connecticut - We have to try and keep jobs here and keepthe money in Connecticut that will flow into Connecticut. We launched aninquiry after you complained about New York license plates on the constructionvehicles (see article [https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/8046dcc5-feaf-43a7-8651-cd3b2a09611c?j=eyJ1IjoiMWh2cjYwIn0.VBabVq-VHATXCJqsddI7uMpdiTm0WkVanRDZfvCWMkg ]). Electricity - As for electricity, ourbills have gone up significantly because of the public benefit. The electriccompany should pay for these green initiatives which benefits them by reducingtheir need to supply additional electricity. You are not obligated to helpyour neighbor make improvements in a classic taxation without representation.In the interim, I have proposed a deduction on your taxes for this mandatewhile you push your local State Reps and Senators to push back.

The Border - The border is anotherbig issue, which is woven into many of these other issues and impacts ourlives. I am all about closing the border especially after Prison gangs of Trende Aragua are now killing people in Stamford (See Article [https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/7667e6c8-96e7-49d0-81cc-99e45fa49e5a?j=eyJ1IjoiMWh2cjYwIn0.VBabVq-VHATXCJqsddI7uMpdiTm0WkVanRDZfvCWMkg ]).

Most of Americans are in agreement oncrime and safety. However, Jim Himes has been horrible on the Border and evensuggested that we should bring refugees from Gaza. (See our article on Hamasand Himes [ https://open.substack.com/pub/drmichaelgoldstein4ct/p/no-process-is-strong-enough-to-vet?r=26c3ku&utm;_campaign=post&utm;_medium=web ])Veterans - We\u2019ve also talked about how veterans have been ignored with bettertreatment given to illegals and the lack of good resources for veterans totreat their PTSD and other ailments following their service to this gratefulnation. (See our Article on Our Veterans [https://open.substack.com/pub/drmichaelgoldstein4ct/p/what-about-our-veterans-vote-august?r=26c3ku&utm;_campaign=post&utm;_medium=web ]). Israel - Harrisand Himes have been terrible on Israel despite the fact Jim Himes largestdonor is AIPAC. Himes has pandered to CAIR and was silent when both PresidentBiden and Vice President Harris snubbed Netanyahu and Israel on a veryimportant diplomatic mission. That was their first mission since October 7.(See our Article on Biden and Harris Snub Israe [https://open.substack.com/pub/drmichaelgoldstein4ct/p/biden-and-harris-snub-israel?r=26c3ku&utm;_campaign=post&utm;_medium=web ]l) . These protests andviolence on college campuses needs to end.

Peter, this is a BIG deal. A toss-up meansit\u2019s anyone\u2019s game. Rush a $30 donation to the NDRC in these final days andhelp turn these \u201cTOSS-UP\u201d chambers into wins for fair maps. State legislativeraces are often decided by just a few hundred votes, so a contribution of anyamount can make a measurable difference in the outcomes.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ndrc-em-nov24?refcode=don_ndrc_tier1_email_TossUps_email_20241102-NDRC-Tier1-TossUps_&utm;_source=email&utm;_medium=email&utm;_term=don&utm;_content=20241102-NDRC-Tier1-TossUps_&utm;_campaign=TossUps&amount;=30] These \u201ctoss-ups\u201d include bothchambers in the Arizona legislature, the New Hampshire State House, theMichigan State House, the Minnesota State House, and the Pennsylvania StateHouse. Here\u2019s a quick analysis of what\u2019s at stake in each state: \u27a1\ufe0f Arizona:Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of the Arizona legislature, butif we flip just two seats in each, we can flip both the state house and statesenate and strengthen the state\u2019s redistricting process. \u27a1\ufe0f Michigan: WhileDemocrats hold a trifecta in Michigan, Republicans are vying to take back thestate house this November. If they do, they could attempt to roll backprogress on fair maps by targeting the state\u2019s independent redistrictingcommission. \u27a1\ufe0f Minnesota: Democrats won a surprise trifecta of their state\u2019sgovernment in 2022, but this year, only the state house is on the ballot.Republicans need to flip just five seats to win back control and block all theamazing progress we\u2019ve seen there in the last two years. \u27a1\ufe0f New Hampshire:It\u2019s the Republicans who hold a trifecta in New Hampshire \u2014 and since mid-cycle congressional redistricting is permitted in this state, the GOP coulduse their power to rewrite their maps at any given moment. (The Republicancandidate for governor has even said they hope to do so.) Democrats need towin the legislature to put an end to the possibility of mid-cycle GOPgerrymandering. \u27a1\ufe0f Pennsylvania: Democrats hold the state house and thegovernor\u2019s seat, but Republicans control the state senate. If we can protectthe state house majority and flip the state senate, we will achieve anotherDemocratic trifecta and have the ability to enact redistricting reform inPennsylvania. These are races that are critical to the long-term fight forfairness \u2014 and being successful in these elections could help lay thefoundation for an even fairer redistricting process in 2031. With just 3 daysuntil the final votes are cast, we need a surge of support to fund our work toelect Democracy Defenders across the country and help keep the fair mapsmovement moving forward.

This moment has been building up for months. Hovde and his Republicanallies launched a $80 million ad blitz to close the polling gap and buy thisseat, and they've never been closer to succeeding. I don't mean to bealarmist, Peter, but we're running out of time to fight back. Republicans areoutspending us on the airwaves, early voting is underway, and all signs showmy self-funding megamillionaire opponent surging. This incredible grassrootsteam has helped me defy the odds before, but I'm going to need more supporterschipping in and standing with me now than ever in order to defend this crucialSenate seat. So, will you split an urgent donation between EMILYs List and mycampaign to help me close the polling gap between me and my right-wingopponent so we can win this toss up race?

Wokeiststry to negate centuries of tradition, culture and science (!) by sociallyshaming opposing views and using coercive tactics on young children to adoptconcepts that go against every grain of common sense and human understandingof the world around us. Woke gender ideology, being so totally antithetical tothe Latino language and culture, plays a huge part of why Hispanics areuniversally turning away from the Democrat party.\" \"Now the left wants toreplace Latino with \u2018Latinx.\u2019 It is the woke objective to erase gender bychanging the masculine default of Spanish plural words: canceling the \u2018os\u2019 atthe end of words by replacing it with an X. The gender confusion communityseeks to do whatever it can to remove the uniqueness and importance ofmasculine and feminine in our culture, and in our language. Are we to begin tocall our sons and daughters by ninx rather than nina or nino, ourgrandchildren nietx, our students alumnx, our friends amigx, our neighborsvecinx, and our partners companerx? We must end this abuse of language andstop the disrespect of our masculine and feminine natures.

We have received record numbers of individual, small-dollardonations, and I am so proud of that fact. But according to campaign financerecords -- when you factor in super PAC spending -- we are being heavilyoutspen by Derrick Van Orden and his extremist, deep-pocketed allies. They\u2019vealso just doubled their ad buys in our most competitive media markets. It goeswithout saying that if we lose these key communities, we lose the election.The good news is, our message is powerful enough, and the polling is closeenough that with a surge of individual donations we can win. But that is goingto take people who care enough about the outcome to make today the day theydonate to our campaign. Can you contribute today to help flip WI-03? Ouraverage online donation is just over $40. Some give more. Some give less. Butwhat matters the most is that we get as many people donating as we can,because it adds up fast.

Quite frankly, I'm really worried we could lose, andthe only way I can pull ahead in this final sprint is with your grassrootssupport. So please, will you rush $5 or more now to help me fight back againstthis barrage of MAGA Republican attack ads?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rosenfornevada_email_1124?refcode=jtk5368-fr-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Republicans know they\u2019re close to flippingNevada red \u2013 and the Senate and White House right along with it, friend.That's why they've poured $75 million into this battleground to defeat me \u2013including a surprise $6.2 million ad buy the other day to blanket the airwaveswith even more attacks between now and Election Day. My campaign has launchedour own set of TV ads to keep the record straight and reach as many voters aswe can before it's too late. But if we can't raise another $78,910 beforemidnight, we can\u2019t afford to keep these ads on the air.

I know a few things about winning elections here in California, so I want to give you a peek behind the scenes on where things stand: First, here\u2019s what\u2019s at stake: Political analysts, the media, and even *Republicans* themselves agree that control of the U.S. House is likely to come down to California in this election. And now, new polling shows Democrats taking the lead in the \u201cmust-win\u201d swing seats . But the one thing that can trip us up now, is not having the resources needed to seal the deal and flip these districts. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you to make a special donation to the California Democratic Party\u2019s Swing Seat Fund so that we can deploy organizers, keep regional offices open later, print more literature, organize more canvases, and more. Will you pitch in?

This is more tossup seats than ANY other state in the country. And across these seats, polling shows Democrats taking the momentum . With these swing districts in California *alone*, Democrats can retake the U.S. House and fire Speaker Mike Johnson. But the problem is that because the media has been so focused on the buzzy swing states in the presidential contest, Democrats have not been paying attention to California and our make-or-break role in the battle for U.S. House control. We need to shift into high gear and ensure all these competitive districts have the resources needed to flip blue next week. That\u2019s why I am personally asking you to make a special gift of $ or more. Will you help?

After giving nearly $75 million to a super PAC supporting Donald Trump, Elon Musk has been using me to spread right-wing misinformation about elections in Michigan. He invoked my image to stoke his conspiracies and lay the groundwork to disenfranchise Michigan voters if he and other Trump Republicans don\u2019t like the result of this election. Look, we know exactly what Elon is trying to accomplish. The road to the White House runs through Michigan, and he\u2019s doing whatever he can to confuse voters and muddy the waters to give Donald Trump a better chance of winning our 15 electoral votes. Michiganders are voting right now, so we need to act fast to combat this right-wing misinformation. I\u2019ve always done everything I can to keep our elections free, fair, and accessible to everyone who is eligible to cast a ballot. And I won\u2019t stop now.

And another who is choosing hope over fear, country over party, and is leading a way forward based in hope and fighting for our freedoms. Vice President Harris has a plan that invests in America\u2019s future and builds our economy from the bottom up and the middle out. With just three days left, will you pitch in $3 or more right now to help us elect Vice President Harris in the 13th District?

Living across fromTrump's Golf Course, I had to see a reminder every day of how easily and oftenour government supports and enables the ultra-wealthy at the expense ofworking families. You see, the New York City government shoveled over $100million in government aid to develop this golf course with Donald Trump andthe corrupt Trump Organization. They did this while New York families likemine lived in hunger and poverty across the street.

I hope youfeel like you have a better sense of who I am and what my values are. I swearthat I'm fighting for those values every day in Congress.

But he still has a strong base of supporters. If someone with a historylike Robinson\u2019s can still be in the running, we\u2019re facing a bigger problemthan just one election. Robinson winning could set North Carolina backdecades, empowering hate and divisiveness in our state. I want young people toknow that the path to power isn\u2019t paved by discrimination and inflammatoryrhetoric. So, will you help me stand against hateful rhetoric like Robinson\u2019sand ensure he doesn\u2019t get elected by chipping into my voter outreach fundright now?

Thanks to thisgrassroots team, we've been running ads across Florida in English and Spanish\u2014 and based on the numbers shared in our team meeting this morning, they areworking. The first week they aired, I shot up 3 points in the polls. Now, I'mLESS THAN 2 POINTS AWAY from taking Rick Scott's dwindling lead altogether.But actually clinching the lead means not only keeping my ads on the air butalso launching new ones \u2014 and based on the metrics shown in that same meeting,our fundraising numbers just hit a 30-day low: Without your help to close the52% gap on my LAST $4 million goal and keep funding my ads until Election Day,we risk losing all the momentum we've gained so far.

That is, friend, unless I cancount on your help to stop the bleeding and meet my final $4 million goal. Inever would've entered striking distance of Rick Scott without your help, andI won't be able to overtake him in these final hours without you. Please,friend, will you rush $5, $25, or anything you can spare now to keep mecompetitive in the race to retire Rick and flip this Senate seat blue?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mw_dmp_2024_email_fr?refcode=jtk2481-fr-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for everything, Debbie -------- Thisemail was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

I truly appreciate all you\u2019ve done to support my campaign.But I still need help-this race is still too close!

It takes alot of time and money to set the record straight\u2026 For example, on the borderAllred now claims to love border security, and belatedly says he wants to finda solution to the Biden-Harris border crisis, but that\u2019s not how Allred votedin Congress\u2026 In Congress, Allred was an Open Borders Radical who voted AGAINSTthe interests of Texas and FOR open borders lawlessness numerous times: Allredvoted AGAINST the Secure the Border Act. Allred voted AGAINST denouncing theBiden Administration\u2019s immigration policies. Allred voted AGAINST condemningthe Biden border crisis and the tremendous burdens law enforcement officersface as a result. Allred voted AGAINST the POLICE Act, which would immediatelydeport any illegal alien who assaults a law enforcement officer. Allred votedAGAINST the SAVE Act, which was a bill that would block illegal aliens fromvoting in U.S. elections. And perhaps most shamefully, Allred SKIPPED a voteon the End the Border Catastrophe Act\u2026 It takes a lot of time and money to setthe record straight\u2026and of course the liberal media is working overtime tohelp Allred hide his record.

Fellow Patriot,I have an important message that I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be sending you today. Injust a moment, I am going to ask you to make a contribution to my campaign forU.S. Senate. November 5th isdays away, and I\u2019d really appreciate the chance toexplain why this request \u2014 especially today \u2014 is so critically important.Here\u2019s the truth: Right now, we have a week of media buys to pay for \u2014 themost important week of the entire campaign. And if we don\u2019t raise what we neednow, we will be forced to give up the airwaves and let Adam Schiff and theDemocrat-machine backing him up run their attacks on me unopposed. Whatmatters most right now is that we do whatever we can to fund a campaign thatcan win. That\u2019s the most important thing. Winning this race. Not just for thesake of winning, but because of what it would mean to substitute my presencewith Adam Schiff\u2019s in the Senate. That\u2019s a reality I don\u2019t think any of uswant to consider, but it\u2019s what will happen if we come up short. Now, time isrunning out. So, this is the part where I ask, one more time, and very humbly:Can you please use this link to make a donation to my campaign for U.S. Senatein California before Election Day?

Butit\u2019s also one of the most important, so it really would mean a lot to me ifyou could read through it. If you\u2019re in a hurry or if you\u2019re already sold andready to do whatever it takes to help me defeat Larry Hogan and defend ourSenate majority, [https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/33436?t=1010&amount;=25&akid;=3181%2E52803%2E7kOuRk]then please consider making a quick grassroots contribution to give us theresources and momentum to win this race in just 3 days! [https://act.angelaalsobrooks.com/go/33436?t=1011&amount;=25&akid;=3181%2E52803%2E7kOuRk]Donate I want to outline our campaign's message to fill Maryland\u2019s open U.S.Senate seat. It hinges on 3 major components: Power to the People Thiscampaign has never been about me, Peter. It\u2019s always been about Marylanders,our families, and our communities. And when Republican Larry Hogan entered therace putting our Democratic Senate majority at risk, it became about thefuture of the entire country. That\u2019s why Republicans are pouring millions ofdollars into this race. But during the Democratic Primary, we proved thatMaryland is won by the many, not by the money. We\u2019ve never had limitlessresources, million dollar checks, or shady dark money super PACs pulling thestrings. Instead, we built a grassroots coalition of people in every corner ofthe state who stepped up to volunteer, donate, and talk to their neighborsabout our campaign. Your time and your contributions were the driving forcebehind our primary victory, and we need to continue building on that in orderto win on Tuesday. Focus on the Issues that Matter While Republicans arelining up to get behind Donald Trump and his divisive MAGA agenda, we'refocusing on the issues that matter most to people \u2014 like protecting abortionrights, improving wages, and preserving our democracy. My Republican opponentLarry Hogan hopes Marylanders won\u2019t remember that as governor, he vetoedlegislation that would have expanded access to abortion care throughout thestate. He\u2019s banking on Marylanders forgetting that he vetoed a $15 minimumwage and legislation to benefit unions and workers. He\u2019s hoping Marylanderswon\u2019t realize that electing him means handing control of the Senate over toextremists like Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham. On the issues that matter most,Hogan\u2019s record speaks for itself: He\u2019s all wrong for Maryland, and he\u2019ll sayand do whatever he thinks will win him this seat. Make the Case for aDemocratic Senate Majority Here\u2019s the truth, Peter: There simply isn\u2019t any wayDemocrats maintain our razor-thin Senate majority if Larry Hogan wins thisopen seat. Mitch McConnell handpicked Hogan for this race because he seesMaryland as his best chance to flip a seat, retake the majority, and enact hisfar-right, anti-choice agenda. If the GOP retakes the Senate, they'll have thepower to pass a national abortion ban, roll back environmental protections,undermine our elections, and so much more. Hogan has proven that he cannot betrusted to protect our reproductive rights or put Maryland families first.Defending the Senate is the only way to protect our freedoms, uplift workingfamilies, and preserve our democracy. We\u2019ve got a winning message that\u2019sresonating with voters, Peter, and I need your support to make sure everyonehears it.

Regardless of the outcome, it's clear that ourcountry is divided and in desperate need of new leaders who can unify everydaypeople across our shared priorities and against our shared enemies:corporations, billionaires, and right-wing extremists. Everyday people don'tsee any party fighting for their interests anymore. They see what we see:corporate Super PACs and billionaire donors dictating an agenda that rewardsthe wealthy few at the expense of everyone else. The outcomes of Tuesday'selection will drastically reshape the future of our nation and will demanddifferent urgencies from our movement. But no matter what, this moment callsfor building a new Democratic Party, led by new leaders that working familiesactually see fighting for their most pressing needs.

InsiderAdvantage \u2014 October 2024 Eric Hovde (R): 49% [+1] Tammy Baldwin (D): 48% Ever since Eric Hovde closed the polling gap in this race, Republicans see Wisconsin as one of their best opportunities to flip a Democrat-held Senate seat red. That\u2019s why Hovde, Mitch McConnell, and their right-wing allies have poured $100 million into Wisconsin to defeat Tammy. Tammy\u2019s opponent is surging at the worst possible time. Early and absentee voting is well underway. More than one million votes have already been cast, and we\u2019re running out of time to get our message in front of voters before polls close in just three days. Wisconsin elections always come down to the wire and this race is looking no different \u2014 which means every dollar matters in our final voter outreach efforts.

In Texas, thelaw provides prison for life, for healthcare providers, for doing what theybelieve is in the best interest of their patient. In some counties in Texas,they have passed travel bans to prevent women from going to other states toreceive care. These are the stakes \u2014 and we know how we got here. \u201d She\u2019sright \u2014 we do know how we got here: In 2021, Texas completely banned abortionwith very limited exceptions. Then, the Texas Supreme Court then ruled that awoman did not qualify for an abortion under the state\u2019s medical exceptiondespite the fact that her doctor determined she needed the procedure to saveher life. That decision forced a pregnant woman to travel out of state toreceive the care she needed to save her life. The justices doubled down onthat extreme decision this year, ruling against 20 women who said they weredenied the ability to receive medically necessary abortions as a result of thestate\u2019s extreme abortion ban. This is unconscionable, Peter \u2014 and we won\u2019t siton the sidelines while elected state supreme court justices rip away people\u2019srights. The NDRC is proud to have endorsed Judge DaSean Jones, Judge ChristineWeems, and Judge Bonnie Lee Goldstein for the Texas Supreme Court because oftheir commitment to be fair-minded, conduct an independent evaluation of thelaw, ensuring rights and protecting freedoms.

So many people have already voted that it\u2019s clear voting is nowmore a season than a single-day event. And while the way we vote might havechanged over the years, the importance of voting hasn't changed a bit. Do YouHave a Plan to Vote? Will You Bring a Friend Along to the Polls? Your votemight be the one that makes a difference in this election. With so much on theline in this election, we can\u2019t afford to sit it out. I hope you enjoy thesefun voting facts (Make Voting Fun Again!), but most importantly, I hope youMAKE A PLAN TO VOTE! Five Fun Facts about Voting & Elections Absentee Voting:Must Be More than Two Miles from Home Pennsylvania was the first state toallow absentee voting during the War of 1812, but you had to be at least twomiles from home! Bring Your Own Ballot (BYOB?) It wasn\u2019t until the election of1888 that ballots became standardized in the U.S. Before then, voters oftenbrought ballots passed out by political parties or wrote down their choices.Astronauts Can Vote from Space Thanks to a Texas law passed in 1997,astronauts can cast their votes from space. Using a secure ballot, NASAensures astronauts are never left out, even when orbiting the Earth. WhyTuesday? Why November? Tuesday was selected to avoid Sundays (for church) andWednesdays (market days for farmers). November was chosen because it was afterthe harvest season and before the harsh winter weather. Voting Wasn\u2019t AlwaysSecret Before the 1890s, there was nothing secret about voting. In fact, atthat time, many people believed voting should be a public act.

Most people don't know I grew up inSpringfield, Ohio. My mom was a seamstress and my dad was a factory worker,and I saw up close how hard they worked to support our family.

Senate control will be determined by Sherrod's race, so we must standtogether to protect reproductive rights, defend Social Security and Medicare,and save our democracy. This race is going to be tight. Polls show Sherrodnarrowly trailing his Trump-backed opponent, and political experts have calledSherrod one of the most vulnerable senators up for reelection. Republicanswill do anything to defeat Sherrod, and they've outspent him 3-to-1 to attackhim relentlessly. That's why I had to reach out, friend. Sherrod needs ourgrassroots support right away: Will you chip in $5 or $25 to help Sherrod winin Ohio and keep the Senate blue?https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sherrod-brown-email-wr-24?refcode=jtk3797-fr-text&amounts;=250,100,50,25,5 Ohio means a lot to me,and the working families there \u2013 and across America \u2013 deserve to have Sherrodin the U.S. Senate.

Here\u2019s THREE reasons whythis campaign is one of the most important House races in the country rightnow: 1\ufe0f\u20e3The DNC made a HISTORIC investment in Texas, shouting out our raceright here in TX-15, because they know we\u2019re against the ONLY vulnerable GOPHouse member in TX. 2\ufe0f\u20e3The House Majority PAC launched over $1.3 MILLION in TVads to help Michelle win, because they know our race is the PATH to aDemocratic majority. 3\ufe0f\u20e3The last poll showed our campaign only THREE pointsaway from our opponent, because WE know South Texans are sick and tired of herMAGA extremism. With only three days left, this is a make or break moment forour campaign. If you\u2019re all in to help us defeat our anti-choice, MAGAextremist opponent, can you join us by chipping in just $3 right now? We needto raise $15k to fund our last minute voter outreach efforts, and yourdonation could make all the difference!

He found a piece of grassy land, tooka look at it, and said, \u201cThis is the place.\u201d And that\u2019s where the farm began.He farmed the land until the early 1940s, and then passed it down to my folks.In 1978, my wife Sharla and I took over the farm and we\u2019re still here today,three generations and more than 40 years later. We\u2019ve made a lot of progresshere \u2014 Sharla and I built a new home, several steel buildings, and morestorage. The truth is, I love this work. Yes, it makes for early mornings andlate nights during planting and harvest seasons \u2014 but it also keeps megrounded, and it gives me perspective on the issues we face every day. When Ithink about climate change, I\u2019m thinking of folks on farms like mine,struggling with catastrophic droughts or historic levels of flooding. When Ithink about reforming the USPS, I\u2019m thinking of the people in ruralcommunities across Montana who rely on timely mail delivery for theirmedication or Social Security checks. And when I think about infrastructure,I\u2019m thinking of the rural towns near mine that need access to affordable,high-speed internet. These aren\u2019t abstract issues or talking points. They\u2019revery real challenges that deserve real solutions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m fightingfor in Washington. I spend every single day trying to do right by workingfamilies, farmers, students, and veterans here in Montana and across thecountry. I\u2019m running for reelection because there\u2019s still work to be done.Just like my parents and grandparents on the family farm, when I commit tosomething, I see it through. Can you make a split donation of any amount todaybetween my campaign and Voter Protection Project to help me keep up the fightin Washington?(https://act.protectvoting.org/go/83981?t=1003&akid;=17887%2E878179%2EtbMk5w)I\u2019ll leave you with one last truth about farming: Some years you get the rightamount of rain, and things work out really well. Other years, you get a wholelot less. That means it\u2019s important to be prepared for any outcome, and tohave a support system by your side when things get difficult. We don\u2019t knowwhat this campaign will look like, or what Republicans will throw our way overthese final few months. But with your support, we\u2019ll be ready. I appreciateanything you\u2019re able to pitch in. Thanks for your help, and I hope I make youproud. \u2014 Jon ------------------ Paid for by Voter Protection Projectwww.protectvoting.org Not authorized by any candidate or candidate'scommittee. 401 2nd Ave. S, Ste. 303, Seattle, WA 98104 Click here to requestfewer emails: https://act.protectvoting.org/signup/fewer-emails/?t=1001&akid;=17887%2E878179%2EtbMk5w Click here to unsubscribe:https://act.protectvoting.org/unsubscribe/unsubscribe/?akid=17887%2E878179%2EtbMk5w",

As we get closer to Election Day, I wanted to shine a light on Lisa Blunt Rochester, the Congresswoman from Delaware. Right now, she is in a heated race to become Delaware\u2019s next Senator. In a minute, I\u2019ll explain why you should chip in to support Lisa\u2019s historic campaign. [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q42024] SUPPORT LISA \u2192 [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/loc_lbr_fr_q42024] Lisa\u2019s career as a public servant epitomizes the definition of what it means to be a leader and champion for everyone. Time and time again, she has helped create and pass meaningful legislation to build up our middle class, protect our seniors, and defend our voting and reproductive rights. In short, Lisa\u2019s mission of Bright Hope is one she hopes to bring to the Senate. But her self-funding opponent would rather spend nearly a million dollars to keep his campaign afloat and defend the overturning of Roe. I wish I was joking on that last point. The scary thing about all of this is that Delaware will be crucial to the Democrats\u2019 hopes of protecting their Senate majority. With a one-seat majority on the line, we need to do everything we can to lock this seat down and make Lisa the first Black and woman senator from Delaware. Folks \u2013 Election Day will be here before you know it. And in order to stop Trump, Vance, and Project 2025, we need to support Lisa Blunt Rochester by chipping in $10 or more to her campaign today.

She was born in Albuquerque and lived for most of her childhood in a home near the intersection of Lomas and Monroe with her seven siblings, and her parents - Pete and Nancy Domenici. Nella began her education at Our Lady of Fatima, where she learned the values she holds today. Nella is a proud third-generation New Mexican, devoted mother of two, step-mom of four, and the wife of a Navy Veteran. Nella\u2019s family\u2019s roots run deep in New Mexico and she and her husband Pat enjoy their family home in New Mexico that they have owned for nearly twenty years. Like most New Mexicans, Nella Domenici understands the importance of hard work. She waited tables to help pay for her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and worked her way through night school at Georgetown Law while holding down a full time job. She then graduated from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar, top 5% of the class, while 9 months pregnant. Nella began her career at the bottom and worked her way up through the complex finance world, eventually serving as CFO for one of the world\u2019s largest, most successful investment firms. In her career, Nella advised, invested in, grew, and led many companies, and served on public company boards. The industries she has worked in are vast and include areas such as health care, AI, food service, lodging, commercial real estate, mortgage lending, and consumer products. These companies have ranged from small family-owned businesses, to rapidly growing venture backed enterprises, to a Fortune 200 company. Several of these have been headquartered in New Mexico. Collectively, the companies Nella has been heavily involved with have employed thousands of Americans. Like her father and mother, Nella has been a warrior for those who most need an advocate: for women competing in academics or business, for families dealing with mental illness, and for those without access to quality healthcare or education.

Let me explain:Over the past month, I've been on the ground in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, anda few other key states. I've talked to voters, candidates, and volunteers allacross the country. And I can tell you firsthand that the polls and thepundits are right: our women's races will be close. There's a saying inpolitics, beloved by fundraisers and field organizers alike: the margin ofeffort. When the polls are tight, and a race could go either way, what mattersmost is the heart, grit, and commitment of the supporters. If we put in thework, we'll win. If we don't, we won't. It's that simple. Critical races likeVP Kamala Harris', Sen. Tammy Baldwin's (WI-SEN), and Rep. Susan Wild's(PA-07) now fall squarely within the margin of effort. And your support canhelp make sure we reach as many voters as possible before Nov. 5. Let's giveit all we've got, Peter.

I\u2019ve really enjoyed hitting the campaign trail and meeting with voters who are fired up and ready to win this race. We\u2019re one step closer to flipping OR-05 and taking back the House. But here's the bad news : We\u2019re up against millions of dollars in spending by deep-pocketed Republicans. My opponent, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, is backed by Republican special interest groups who are willing to spend whatever it takes to hold this seat. As they put more money into this race, we need a flood of support to fight back and make sure we\u2019re not getting drowned out on the airwaves.

Right-wing authoritarianism, defeated by a worldwide coalition during WWII, was only in hibernation. Over the past decade it has infected democratic societies--including ours. It is as simple as it is terrifying: What we do now will define the future of our country and world. We at Blue Amp Action are dedicated to liberal, open societies, where reason and science are applied to solve our problems; where civil rights--including voting rights!--are protected for all. We fight for these values every day. Speaking up on our platforms, raising the voices and the political prospects of liberal pols and pundits. **And savvy grassroots activists like you know, just like we do, that we can\u2019t stop watching the people we help elect:_ after the elections, we have to keep organizing support for the policies we like and pushing back against the ones we don\u2019t._** **__When the public tunes out between elections and the only people our elected officials hear from are the paid lobbyists of wealthy corporations, our government stops being accountable to the needs of ordinary families.__** **Democracy never sleeps, and neither can we.** So we ask that you support our work, so we can continue to engage in this fight every moment of every day.

But I thought alittle reminder would be helpful, especially contrasted with who Rick Scott is\ud83e\udd2e.Maybe it will even motivate you to make a donation before tonight'sfundraising deadline to ensure I can defeat Rick Scott! First and foremost,I'm everything I am today because of my mother. She brought my sisters and meto America when I was just 14. Mom knew we had to get out of Ecuador, whichwas transitioning to democracy after suffering under a military dictatorship.She knew America was the key to a better life. Well, with a whole lot of hardwork (including working in a doughnut shop to help my family get by), longhours, and a ton of hope, we were able to win our American dream. My story iswhat inspires me to give back to this incredible country and state that gaveme so much. After putting myself through college, I worked for severalnonprofit organizations across Florida, helping toprotect our wildlife andpreserve our coral reefs. Rick Scott, on the other hand, banned saying thewords \"climate change\" when he was governor of Florida, and the League ofConservation Voters gave him a whopping 0% score last year. During my timeworking at Florida International University, I spearheaded a new programtoexpand affordable health care access to more Floridians. But Rick Scott hasvoted to repeal the Affordable Care Act more times than I care to count. Andwho can forget he committed one of the largest Medicare frauds in the historyof our country. Eventually, I had the honor of serving my community in theU.S. House of Representatives, where I became the first South Americanimmigrant to be elected to Congress! In the House, I wrote the bill toexpandseniors\u2019 Medicare Advantage coverage, worked with Republicans to provideeconomic relief to families and small businesses, andsecured $200 million forEverglades restoration. I'm proud of my record \u2014 but can Rick Scott say thesame, friend? He has used his time in office writing the plan to end SocialSecurity and Medicare, attempting to undermine our elections, attacking ourrights, and making it harder for working families to get ahead. As a result,Rick Scott's approval ratings with Floridians are underwater. Even a largepercentage of Republicans don't approve of him! Now, polling shows mestatistically tied with Scott, and in just 8 days, we can defeat him andprotect our Democratic Senate majority in the process. But with Rick Scottoutspending me 3-1 on the airwaves, it's going to take a surge in grassrootssupport from people like you to truly defeat him. So please, rush a donationof $5 or whatever you can to send me to the U.S. Senate and give Floridiansthe true leader and public servant we deserve!

That means flipping the House to secure a majority that willprotect their rights and their medical autonomy, act on climate, get weaponsof war off the streets, slash child poverty, safeguard our democracy, and keepthe American Dream within their grasp. Democrats are just 4 seats away fromflipping the House blue. But we\u2019re facing a record level of spending by theGOP in this final stretch and polling couldn\u2019t be tighter in the handful ofraces that will decide control of Congress. Your support today is what willmake these races break in our favor. That\u2019s why I\u2019m personally asking if youwill donate directly to 6 Democrats running in 6 toss-up Red-to-Blue Houseraces ahead of their deadlines tonight. If Christina Bohannan (IA-1), Dr.Amish Shah (AZ-1), Janelle Bynum (OR-5), George Whitesides (CA-27), JohnMannion (NY-22), and Tony Vargas (NE-2) win we have the numbers to flip theHouse blue. https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kl-email-241018-314?refcode=KL_ATA_EM_FR_314_241025_T1_2_b Christina Bohannan (IA-1) \u2013 Christina is anenvironmental engineer and law professor who defeated a 20-year incumbent tosecure a seat in the Iowa State Legislature. In 2020, Republicans flipped thisseat from blue to red by the slimmest margin of any House race in nearly anentire century \u2013 a margin of just 6 votes (0.01% of the vote). And pollingconfirms it could be just as competitive this November. Normington, Petts &Associates Poll: Bohannan 47% \u2013 Miller-Meeks 47% Dr. Amish Shah (AZ-1) \u2013 Amishis an Emergency Room physician at the Mayo Clinic of Arizona and StateRepresentative who had the most bills signed into law of any Arizona Democratof the past decade. In 2022, Republicans barely defended this seat by a marginof just 3,195 votes (which was less than 1% of the vote). It could be evencloser this time around. In 2020, Joe Biden won this district by 1.5%. ImpactResearch Poll: Shah 48% \u2013 Schweikert 48% Janelle Bynum (OR-5) \u2013 Janelle is anelectrical engineer, small business owner, and former State Representative whohas defeated Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer (who she is now running against)not once but twice at the state level. In 2022, Republicans flipped this seatfrom blue to red by a razor-thin margin of just 2.1% of the vote. In 2020, JoeBiden won this district by 8.8% of the vote \u2013 one of the largest margins ofany House seat actively held by a Republican. Noble Predictive Insights Poll:Bynum 43% \u2013 Chavez-DeRemer 42% George Whitesides (CA-27) \u2013 George is anaerospace expert who served as the Chief of Staff for NASA under PresidentBarack Obama, served as CEO of the spaceflight company Virgin Galactic, andco-founded a group to address wildfire disasters. In 2020, Republicans flippedthis seat from blue to red by a razor-thin margin \u2013 just 333 votes (a marginof 0.1% of the vote). In 2020, Joe Biden won this district by a massive marginof 12.4% of the vote \u2013 more than almost any other House district currentlyrepresented by a Republican. University of Southern California Poll:Whitesides 48% \u2013 Garcia 46% John Mannion (NY-22) \u2013 John is a former scienceteacher who won a highly competitive State Senate seat on Republican turf byjust 10 votes to win a seat in the New York State Legislature. In 2022,Republicans barely defended this House seat by a razor-thin margin of just2,631 votes (which is less than 1% of the vote!). In 2020, Joe Biden won thisdistrict by a margin of 7.4% of the vote \u2013 which is part of the reason theNational Journal labeled this as the best red-to-blue pickup opportunity inthe United States! Tony Vargas (NE-2) \u2013 Tony is a former science teacher andschool board member who currently serves in the Nebraska State Senate. In2022, Tony fell just 5,856 votes (a margin of just 2.6% of the vote) offlipping this seat from red to blue.

While I usually wouldn't go into this much detail, I also wouldn't have made it this far without you, so it's only right that you should have full disclosure. But you also need to know that our midnight fundraising deadline is coming up, and I can't afford to fall short on my FINAL $4 million goal \u2014 so before we dig in, can I count on you to rush $10 now to split between me and Kirsten Gillibrand and keep me on track to reach my midnight goal and flip Florida blue? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5620-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Date: Nov. 2, 2024 Subject: [INTERNAL MEMO] The Case for Florida's Senate Race At this stage of the 2024 election, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell's race in Florida is now the Democrats' BEST SENATE PICKUP OPPORTUNITY nationwide: * Columnists at The Washington Post report that Rick Scott has failed to write as many of the \u201cmassive personal checks that he used to win the governor\u2019s mansion.\" * Despite previously self-funding his races at historic levels, Rick Scott has never won an election in Florida by more than 1%. * Debbie's run a highly efficient ad campaign fueled by small-dollar donations, allowing her to reach 76% of voters across Florida's four top media markets. * Recent polls by a GOP-allied firm shows Scott's popularity is tanking by 11 points, and the race is in a DEAD HEAT at Scott 50 - Mucarsel-Powell 48. * Another advantage is the popular ballot initiative for restoring abortion rights, which is expected to help drive turnout similar to that of the 2020 election. * With a personal story that easily counters Scott's \"socialism\" attacks, and regular appearances on Spanish-language media, Debbie can rally Latino voters \u2014 nearly 1 in every 4 voters in Florida \u2014 unlike any other Senate candidate this cycle. The only thing left that Debbie needs to win is a sizable grassroots cash infusion over these final few days before the election. With it, she can help retain the Senate for Democrats, and bring new leadership to the Sunshine State. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5620-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 # # # So friend, now that you know where we stand in the race, there's just one thing left for me to ask you: Will you please chip in $10, $25, or any amount you can spare now to split between Kirsten Gillibrand and me and help to reach my very last $4 million goal on time, retire Rick Scott, and flip Florida's Senate seat blue? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/gfs_dmp?refcode=jtk5620-bu-text&amounts;=5,25,50,100,250 Thank you for all you do.

That\u2019s the amount I am humbly asking you to give to my campaign to help me defeat Lauren Boebert. Yep, just $5. $5 because last year, Adam Frisch lost to Lauren Boebert by just 546 votes. $5 because now Lauren Boebert has moved to my district, and I am the Democratic nominee running against her. $5 because the polling shows Boebert is still incredibly vulnerable and in danger of losing! And $5 because if we turn this seat blue, Democrats are almost guaranteed to take back the House \u2013 and that\u2019s why Lauren Boebert and Speaker Johnson\u2019s Super PACs are attacking me. I know $5 might not seem like much \u2013 and to be honest, it\u2019s not. But over 75,000 grassroots donors like you have already chipped in to my campaign, and we are building a grassroots movement to defeat Lauren Boebert \u2013 $5 at a time. We cannot stop or let up now. Not when we are so close to giving Boebert the boot. My campaign has set a goal to raise another $30,000 to fight back and defeat Lauren Boebert, but we are still extremely far away with time running out before our critical fundraising deadline. **Please, can I count on you to make a donation to my campaign right now \u2013 no amount is too small \u2013 to help me defeat Lauren Boebert, flip this seat blue, and take back the House for Democrats?** _Please use the links in this email to start a weekly donation through ActBlue:_ | | | **DONATE $10** ---  | **DONATE $25** ---  | | **DONATE $35** ---  | **DONATE $50** ---  | | **DONATE $100** ---  | **Other Amount** ---  I have been so humbled by the massive outpouring of support my campaign hasgotten from people like you all across the country.But I\u2019m not taking money from corporate PACs, so I need your continued supportnow if we\u2019re going to win and finally defeat Lauren Boebert.Thank you \u2013 from the bottom of my heart,Trisha  ********Paid for by Trisha 4 ColoradoTrisha 4 Colorado PO Box 630633 Highlands Ranch, CO 80130Contributions or gifts to Trisha 4 Colorado are not tax deductible.This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

We wouldturn this election upside down. We\u2019d raise enough to defeat Kari Lake. UnlikeKari, Ruben can\u2019t depend on a handful of billionaires to bail this campaignout. We\u2019re sustained by the donations of less than 5% of Ruben\u2019s supporters.Without those donations, big or small, we wouldn\u2019t have a chance. That\u2019s whywe need your help.

Let me explain why: As you read this, Trump and his right-wing allies are outspending us on ads attacking my character and values. They are running them in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. _States that we need to win._ I do not lose sleep over what an unhinged and unstable man thinks about me. What _does_ keep me up at night, is what is at stake in this election and the thought of undecided voters seeing his hate-fueled message before we have a chance to correct the record. **We can and must reach these voters -- and that takes significant resources.** Peter, it looks like you are still waiting for the best moment to donate to our campaign. Will you make today the day you chip in your first $47 or $75? Representing Pennsylvania with a contribution is one of the most meaningful actions you can take in the final days of this election. _If you've saved payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:_ | | $47 >> --- | $75 >> --- | $100 >> --- | $250 >> --- | $500 >> --- | Other >> ---  Donald Trump is counting on us to lose momentum.I refuse to give him that satisfaction. And from what I know about thisgrassroots team, you will not either.We are still the underdogs in this race. We are going to win, and it is goingto take grassroots supporters like you joining our fight with a donation tomake it happen.That is why I lean on you a bit more on days like today, Peter.Please use this link to chip in $47 ahead of our campaign\u2019s midnightfundraising deadline. Your $47 donation right now -- not tomorrow, not the dayafter, but today -- will directly fund our work to reach and win overpersuadable voters in these final three days.This is the most consequential election of our lifetime. It would mean theworld to me to see your name on our list of donors for the first time.KamalaKamala Harris Vice President of the United States          * * *| | DONATE --- | TAKE ACTION --- | SHOP ---  * * *This email was sent to **dpwillis67@gmail.com**.
